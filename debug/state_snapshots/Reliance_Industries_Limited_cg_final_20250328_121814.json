      "transcript": "good evening and welcome to the second quarter of financial year 2025 resar presentation of um company Reliance Industries limited first M Shri vachari our group CFO would walk you through the Consolidated performance of the company he will be followed uh by Kiran and Anan walking you through the Digital Services business then DH will talk about the retail business then Sanjay Roy about the EMP business and uh sh come back for the o2c and the summary section over to you sh uh thanks sheni uh good evening friends the performance for uh consolidated uh numbers and highlights so revenues at 258,000 crores up about 8% evid close to 44,000 crores lower by 2% and Pat at 19,000 323 also down about 28 2.8% so um when look at the numbers uh for us there has been robust growth in digital services and Upstream uh offset by V to see and we'll talk about the specific numbers there on detail it has been stady quartered with with a focus on enhancing customer proposition and strengthening capabilities on digital side uh benefiting from improved aru as well as very good momentum in ftth um OTC has been impacted by unfavorable demand Supply fundamentals and as you will see subsequently with the cracks being significantly lower and oil and gas benefiting from sustained volume growth also last time in second quarter fi 24 there was cost related to tapti field decommissioning on the highlights uh so revenues uh down about 1.1% for retail evida 3% higher and Pat about 5.2% higher so uh here Revenue growth impacted by fashion and lifestyle which is uh really in line with industry Trends in our case the the the growth rate was also impacted by the focus on streamlining of operations as well as having a more calibrated approach to B2B which were done with an objective of enhancing margins and uh as you can see we are starting to see some benefit coming through and as you recall this was initiated in the last quarter we talked about that and we are seeing some of that coming through in terms of if you see theida margin from operations at 8 and a half% which is up 40 basis points um we are also scaling up digital Commerce in two ways one uh one is of course scaling up uh hyper local deliveries through our extensive pan India store Network so that's really what uh we are doing also we are strengthening our portfolio in AIO through new brand LA launches Asos H&M Timberland also we are scaling up our ustar format and we have now scaled it up to 50 stores and you will see more rapid growth in this format our focus on strengthening of Tex the tech platforms the infrastructure the streamlining of operations as well as having a calibrated approach in B2B is expected to work its way uh in the next couple of quarters post that we expect to revert uh to our industry leading growth momentum as can be seen even in this quarter because if you see the operational parameters footfalls are up 14% our customer base is up 16% area under uh square feet at 79 million is up 11% number of transactions are higher so so we do expect uh you know this to U to work its way over the next two quarters and then you come back to the kind of growth rates that I talked about on the Digital Services side uh revenue and aidda up 18% and um benefiting from broader scaling up of Digital Services and also partial impact of the Tariff Hi and um we continue to uh add to customers uh overall um slight churn that we we saw in this quarter but nothing unusual in fact lower than what we have seen in the past when there has been a tariff hike data traffic continues to be strong up 24% year on year um about 148 million subscribers have now migrated to True 5G and uh what is also uh feel good about is the fact that the strong connect a good this quarter has been strong for home connects with with our fixed Wireless operator uh with we are adding about 2.8 million go f connections so that's that's been a good rate on o2c side revenues up 5% but AIT are down 24% and U the context of uh uh big Corrections that we saw in fuel cracks both ATF gasoline gas oil all of them down about 50% year on year also Downstream petrochemicals have fallen anywhere between 9 and 24% 24% % was actually PVC demand has been a bit softer with polymer and polyester down between 5 and 7% you know we focused a lot on what we could control which is essentially uh you know leveraging our operational flexibility and um the fact that ethane prices declined by 47% meant that our Ethan cracking economics were strong uh we also uh focused a lot on um placing our products through the the domestic fuel retailing market and that that was 28% higher and continuing focus on optimizing yelds and cost so the for us uh the the strength of the operating model uh was very much at play in terms of trying to negate the impact of such a shop fall in cracks on the oil and gas side U we have seen uh production increases both uh in kgd 6 up 1 and a half% on a year on basis as well as CDM which was up about 24% and of course it was impacted by the price in kgd 6 which was down about 7% and as as I was mentioning in the same time last year we had the cost related to decommissioning of tapti Fe so when you put that in context then we seeing growth in Aida of 11% for with an Aida of 5,290 cror and uh all the numbers together revenues are 2 lh50 ,000 up 8% on a year on year I talked about evida being at 40 close to 44,000 crores being minus 2% and packed at 19323 down about 2.8% um as I said uh overall upstream and digital uh you know supported the growth was was impacted by o2c and also year on-ear Pat was impacted slightly by higher interest and depreciation charges um overall Standalone R had a had a pat of 7,730 so again uh the operating model that we have and the execution and the teams that we have have helped deliver a resilient performance because when you see the o2c numbers in terms of how sharp the fall has been in cracks you know the performance it should be seen in that context and uh this is just the bridge and you can go through it but uh this is year on here and you can see the sharp fall in OTC epida compensated by on the digital side as well as oil and gas um offsetting that retail has been flat uh so when you look at sequential quarter again uh uh Digital Services I talked about benefiting from uh from The partially because of the Tariff hike um and also oil and gas continues to add to that profitability and OT see impacting the portion on the balance sheet side overall September to March almost flat net debt and uh capex at 34,000 crores continues to be covered by cash profits and most of the capex now is in O to see and new energy with significant decline in geoc capex when you see it on a year onye basis with this I'm going to hand it over to Animan and Kieran to take us through on the digital side thank you srihan so on the digit Digital Services side let me start with our 5G Services as you know we call the Geo's 5G offerings Geo true 5G because we believe that there's a combination of spectrum assets and advanced technical features uh especially things like career aggregation uh and of course the Standalone architecture which is quite unique not just in India but globally and we want to today start by talking about a few of the additional technology innovations that we have been able to incorporate into our true 5G Network and this is over and Beyond obviously the the India scale deployment and the fact that we are rapidly now growing the installed base of customers who are using our 5G services so on the technology front uh here are a few of the things which we have been able to incorporate into our network uh the introduction of what we call true 5G voice calling which is called voice over new radio or Warner uh we are not only in our network but we are also working with most of the premium uh handset uh oems to ensure that their devices are by default choosing Warner to be the primary mechanism of voice calling whenever the users are connected to our 5G Network so this means that most people would out of the box get a voice on 5G experience uh which translates into even more Superior voice quality even faster call setup time and of course 5G comes with even more advanced security features so all of the communications will be even more secure than what has traditionally been possible uh another uh Technology Innovation that we have brought in is what we call Advanced interference mitigation since we have so many different Spectrum bands operational between 4G 5G and even within 5G multiple bands uh and especially in dense situations interference is always a problem uh typically the way you manage interference is by making sure one or the other radio backs off so that their signal doesn't interfere with the other uh other radio but that has traditionally been at the expense of certain loss in capacity but what you've been able to do with Advanced uh time division duplex interference mitigation is that even without the loss of capacity now we are able to better manage interference that means 5G customers will have uh much much Superior experience where um traditional things like interference won't impact their throughput because we are a standalone architecture now coming to the network slicing aspect because we are a standard La architecture we are able to very intelligently create Lanes in our Network so that each type of traffic we can adequately provision and manage without any impact on the other type of traffic which is flowing through the network so one example of that is air fiber which is our home broadband service for which we are again using our 5G network uh so air fiber and Mobility have different requirements uh and we want to make sure that those two lanes don't intersect so that the spike in traffic in one of those uh Lanes does not create congestion or uh degradation in the services in the other lane so that's one example of these two lanes running uh again for secure voice and Mission critical Services where we may work with people in the in the safety and health and so on again those are mission critical Lanes for which absolutely none of the other Commercial Services ought to interfere so again we are creating those additional two lanes uh and for certain very very Advanced capabilities and low latency capabilities like gaming or real-time collaboration again the the priority of the packets going through those need to be different so again we are creating additional lanes for that so these are the six virtual Lanes with different types of philosophies that we're creating all on the same 5G network but but we can manage them quite efficiently and differently without any one of them impacting the performance of the other the fourth thing we want to talk about is what we call layer management now layer is a technical term for each spectrum that we have uh but now with improved carer aggregation carer aggregation is where you take all of these different spectrums and make it look like one Consolidated unified network but with layer management we are able to work with some of the advanced capabilities available now in handsets uh to be able to appropriately give the right kind of spectrum for The Right Use case so that the carer ABG is again U very very efficient and optimal uh again uh the smart Spectrum management also means that by allocating the most efficient and energy efficient Spectrum for communicating with the UI the one of the indirect benefits in addition to the performance itself one of the indirect benefits is also that we are able to reduce the power consumption of the handset which which means that now from the from the same handset but working on our Network you are able to get about 20 to 40% uh extended battery life because of the better Energy Efficiency that some of these techniques even enable on the handset uh one of the other aspects of our 5G network is because there are Advanced algorithms like the angle of arrival that we are calculating in our Network that's part of the 5G kind of capability set which means that now these there is better triangulation of devices on our Network and we can get GPS like accuracy up to 10 m if you are connected on 5G which means even if you don't have visibility to the satellite and and and some of those situations we are able to geolocate which means for anything which is things like navigation or or or anything which is hyperlocal use cases they can now start relying on the network to give them very accurate location as compared to what has traditionally been delivered using the GPS services and of course the GPS is also a very energy intensive operation uh so most people are intelligently the handset is connecting only as needed whereas with the network based uh service you are you're all the time having accurate accurate location information in a very energy efficient way also we are bringing in advanced programmability to our Network there are lot more moving pieces in our 5G Network things like uh radio beams traffic steering and again very smart algorithms to manage Energy Efficiency only spending energy where needed with impacting capacity all of these are programmable that means it is not a one-time static configuration but as situations evolve we are able to sense what's happening in our Network and then adapt each of these elements appropriately to unlock your more capacity and bring better Energy Efficiency in our Network and all of this obviously also means that uh there is much better customer experience and because of the programmable nature of a network we are able to sense a lot of these parameters and in many cases even if there is a problem in our Network we are able to do automated root cost analysis and root cost fix very very quickly to mitigate many of these issues now moving on to uh acquisition uh again on the customer experience front uh 5G has created I would say an acceleration in in in adoption uh and and and preference for Geo's network uh and uh to help with the overall experience of uh getting onto the Geo service we have launched a service called GI I activate which is a complete self-service capability that people can have in the comfort of their living room a simple experience where effectively you can from from our Flagship customer engagement app which is called my Geo you can start an Adar based identity verification on a self-service basis uh and if you have an eim automatically the service can be provisioned on the phone even without any help from anybody else but if you don't have eim then we have also arrange for an efficient delivery of the Sim to your doorstep uh very quickly uh and then effectively using a simple video and photo experience we are able to authenticate the user and then of course the user can select whatever plan that they desire and make appropriate payments all of this is an entirely digitally enabled Journey with only one step which is basically the physical delivery of the Sim where required and that's even eliminated with an eim where possible so effectively I a very seamless experience for somebody to get onboarded and we are one of the first people to enable this to happen through the Geo I activate service coming to our home broadband I spoke about how 5G is powering our home broadband service and it has really accelerated our acquisition rate when it comes to uh acquiring homes so uh you can see on the chart here um in the December of 2023 we were doing 6 million Earth quarter the quarter of point we were doing 6 million Acquisitions in that quarter uh but now if you look at this quarter ending ending September we have tripled the the growth in terms of the homes that we are able to add using mainly using GE a fiber uh and we are on track we are already with this rate of acquisition where we have now grown to nearly 3 million geoair fiber Connections in a very short while we are already one of the fastest growing fixed Wireless operators globally uh and this is not where we want to stop we see that there's still much more optimization and and scale up that we are able to do uh and our Target now the next Target that we have is to add nearly 1 million homes every given month so that is the place at which we are able to grow our home broadband uh service thanks to GE a fiber when it comes to the inhome experience itself now we have a great product called Goot TV plus uh which was a unified experience to discover all of the Ott Services which are available especially on the Geo setop box so that from a single interface users can discover and consume uh all their favorite shows and and and movies and so on without having to search and jump across multiple apps and so on so this particular service which was till now on the Geo setop box and and a very well low uh offering we have now also enabled that to be available on other Smart TV platforms so what that means is that if you are a geofiber or Geo air Fiber customer then the Geo same geotv plus uh application which is available on the set toop box is now also available for additional televisions uh that you may have in your home without requiring an additional setop box or an additional connection so it just becomes an additional app that you can download on your TV um without having to uh take additional efforts to enable that to happen uh so what that means is by just getting one connection you are able to enjoy the Goot TV plus experience and all the Ott content that that you are able to uh enjoy not just in the primary TV which is connected to the Geo set toop box but also across additional TVs in the whole coming to the Enterprise business uh again go is continuing to uh gain uh share and in addition to connectivity which of course is uh a very quick adoption that we are seeing across the Enterprise landscape but we are also now able to position and upsell many of our other Digital Services offerings to the same Enterprises so for example we are launching a voice-based Sit based service to Enterprises or now we are also introducing what is called manage Wi-Fi so that the entire Wi-Fi experience within the Enterprise can also be taken as a managed service uh without expending resources or or even investing in assets to make that happen in every office so this is a great service pay as you go for the Enterprise again it's a service that we are bringing uh on top of connectivity to all of the Enterprises uh and again when it comes to multilocation connectivity I think Gio just shines because the breadth of offerings that Gio is able to provide to an Enterprise who especially those who have multiple locations to connect across India We are Becoming by are the the the the technology partner of choice uh and of course on many of our Digital Services like um connectivity platform as a service cpass or the iot the Enterprise iot systems and manage Wi-Fi we are able to add pretty much the leading Enterprises what we call Mar Mary logos over the past quarter when it comes to smv um again uh the fact that for a small business we are able to provide the fastest Broadband experience even up to 1 gigabit per second through air fiber means that uh most a lot of the smbs are now upgrading to these highspeed links which is great because you know that's that's something that only we see Gio being able to provide in the market so that engagement is very strong there and more than 50% of the uh of of of the smbs are choosing to opt for those high bandwidth options uh and again that that that is an exciting dimension for us to deepen our engagement into the SMB segment which which then will be followed by additional Digital Services that we can upsell and cross to the same set of customers now Beyond connectivity I think very recently we also announced a couple of offerings which are very exciting to us because it marries what is traditionally considered to be an infrastructure play with Advanced the next advancement which we see for the country which is in the area of artificial intelligence AI starting with obviously those were on the GE network but certainly extending even beyond that are able to get a completely new tier or new capacity when it comes to being able to store their content on the cloud uh as you know in most cases in India you only get tens of gigabytes of storage from any of the other providers without having to pay for it we are raising the bar by really bringing up that limit all the way up to 100 GB plus uh and uh effectively enabling everybody to to back up a lot of their content into that cloud storage but beyond cloud storage what we trying to do is really add AI algorithms on top of it so that every artifact that you store in the cloud becomes a smart actifa whether it's a photo whether it's a bill whether it's a document there are a whole number of AI use cases that one can layer on top of it and this is only possible if it is hosted in the cloud married to Advanced AI Technologies working all the time so this is our F vision for the future where customer data and customer AI Services uh I think we can bring a completely new set of experiences to the Indian market so watch out for further announcements we looking to launch a beta very quickly and and then Commercial Services thereafter and finally all of this is being enabled by platform that we have created internally called geob brain uh and geob brain is a AI development platform so if you see the inner periph inner periphery of this diagram you can see that all the features which are required by a data scientist to do feature engineering training build certain Advanced algorithms including bringing the latest which is large language models llms into an AI solution they're all available for a user to use so that their productivity is extremely high uh and then we can deliver a a series of uh Services everything from uh whether it is intelligent services like I mentioned in the context of the cloud or enabling zero touch operations uh in in an Enterprise or bringing in very very actionable insights to enable to drive decisions and actions in a company and of course a whole slew of additional AI driven Services all of this uh really can be done in an accelerated way and what we are doing is obviously applying this to a lot of our own operating companies everything from manufactur ing to Telecom retail uh finance and much and much much more so really proving this platform and a beyond the services that we will be able to offer to the market through our operating companies we also looking to then offer this platform itself for as a service to a lot of the Enterprises in India so that they can uh build their own AI Solutions as appropriate for their business so it's a really exciting time and we believe that there will be much more for us to talk about around AI in the coming days with that let me hand it over to my colleague Animan who can talk about the operating and financial performance thank you Kiran uh good evening everyone uh let me take you through the operational and financial uh highlights uh summary for the quarter JPL Consolidated Revenue came in at 3,709 cror that's an 18% year-on-year increase and Aida also grew close to 18% to 15931 this has been a combination of uh both the new homes and and uh new services that we are rolling out as well as the impact of the Tariff increase part of which flew through um in our numbers through this quarter uh as Shan mentioned earlier the subscriber base uh came in at 4788 million there was uh some bit of sim consolidation that we observed though much lesser this time than than what we' observed the last time tariffs have been raised um and we expect this to to taper down as well the AR for the quarter came in at 195.000 rupees um again the partial pass through of the tariffing increase impact uh causing part of this s the 5G and uh which now contributes 24% of our wireless data traffic um and uh we are we are quite happy with with the uptake of the service uh and the the nature of delivery itself um and we expect to keep improving doing on this and you know the total data traffic which went up to 45 exabytes during the quarter uh we expect this to keep growing um on the home side as Kieran mentioned we continue to make good progress fastest growing fixed Wireless operator globally with our GE air fiber offering we we reached 2.8 million subscribers that's almost doubling of the subscriber base uh with our air fiber uh in this last quarter and the Run rate has ramped up significantly moving to the uh customer engagement uh which uh which has been growing steadily and now in the last few quarters fairly rapidly as well uh the total data consumption on the network has doubled in the last three years we now at 4.5 xab for the Quarter U the arpu is also U steadily been growing steadily of course uh there is the impact of tariff increase but in addition the uh customers upgrading subscribers moving to higher plans as their consumption improves and then some of the additional services that we have been able to sell to customers also contributing to the increase in the aru the strong uptake of 5G and home broadband is U is also you know important and and causing the increase in the overall data traffic on the network 24% year on- year the arpu growth of 7.4% year on- year as you know part of the the Tariff increase impact has flown flown through the numbers on the key operating metrices for RG are connectivity business we ended the quarter at 4788 million subscribers as I mentioned there was some bit of consolidation um and delays and recharges that we saw um so there was uh a 10.9 million reduction in the subscriber base but that was more than compensated by the strong increase in arpo itself going up to 195.000 rupees uh for the quarter uh both data consumption and voice consumption on the networks showed very healthy grow data consumptions now at 31 GB per user per month voice consumption continues to be steady at around 977 minutes and moving to the rjil financials um as it can see quite a large increase in this quarter after some City growth over the consistently over the previous few quarters the RG operating Revenue grew 14.5% year on- year and the Abida increased to 15225 CR at an Abida margin of 53.7% and that's also been steadily increasing moving on to the JPL the geop platforms limited Consolidated financials operating revenue for the quarter came in at 3179 um and the bidda at 15 931 the Consolidated Abida margin also slightly above 50% The Profit after tax increased to 6536 cres that was a healthy 23% year- on-year increase in profit after tax so overall uh fairly steady uh performance strong growth during the Quarter U because of a combination of the success that we've seen on the homes as well as the impact of the Tariff increase and more and more data uptake that we seeing from customers uh with that I'm going to hand over to the to take you through the Reliance retail results for the quarter thanks Animan hi good evening everyone on the retail business uh we uh closed the quarter with revenue of 7632 crores uh there was some impact of of on revenues from the weak market demand especially in the fashion lifestyle segment and uh the stream lining of operations which we continue to do uh We've also kind of done some recalibration on our on our to be business uh and all these actions are are are towards further improving improving margins also we had the entire shat period uh during this quarter uh so there were and demand for uh gross you know other than grocery electronics and fashion does go down during that period uh good thing is we are seeing some very strong uh very strong growth in the first two weeks of uh of October as the festival season has started King in and we expect this momentum to continue going on to Diwali and and and Beyond so the Outlook is quite optimistic for this quarter in in that respect the reported eida came in at 5,850 crores eida margin was up uh 30 basis points to 88.8% so the actions that we've taken has had a substantial uh impact on on improving our overall margins all our operational metrics whether it's registered customers number of footfalls in our stores number of transactions all show healthy uh double digit uh uptakes uh the contribution of digital and newcommerce businesses uh was at 177% of our total revenues we opened 464 stores uh during the new stores during the quarter uh with gross edition of 1.9 million square fet of retail area uh the total store count uh at the end of the quarter is 8,946 uh with a total operational area of close to 80 million square fet uh we' have continued our our investments in in in technology to uh to uh improve the customer experience to uh improve our infrastructure uh whether on the supply chain side or on the distribution side so so those Investments uh uh those Investments uh continue uh in order to have a healthy strong platform for for future growth during the quarter we entered into a partnership with Delta Galil uh to have the backend supply chain manufacturing for our laundry business this is a joint venture with them uh we also launched Asos uh in in India during this quarter so as I spoke about cross Revenue was up 1% on a quarter on quarter basis uh there's a 1% decline on a YY basis uh from an eida margin perspective 40 basis points growth in eida margin from operations and total eeda margin increased by 30 basis points due to a mar decline in in investment income

deliver pretty quickly and in we have already have existing infrastructure U which is there uh through because through which we are able to deliver pretty quickly a wide assortment without any uh without any incremental fixed cost which gives us a big advantage over our rpers uh we're also driving the share of non-grocery categories uh the average order value for non- grocery categories was of up to X led by Electronics uh we are X while while all our all our categories and and categories are present on the platform uh to fill any gaps and provide consumers the widest choice we continue to add external sellers onto the platform as well uh the option count was up 133% on a YY basis milk basket which is a premium Subscription Service uh continues to deliver steady growth as we uh expand uh in and go deeper in the geographies that we are in and drive higher aovs higher share of fmcg uh categories uh in in in in in our orders so that's something that that's working well for us uh consumer Brands uh business continues to scale up very nicely uh we are expanding our our distribution network uh the general trade of revenues are growing at 250% Plus on a y basis uh we continue to launch new products several new products will launch under under Brands like Campa Independence maliban ra Campa and Independence specifically are are scaling up pretty pretty nicely and and growing from strength to strength we have also undertaking several marketing initiatives to to promote these Brands uh and we leverage some of the festive periods to to drive drive demand for these products overall all in all uh the the the long-term fundamentals are are are are are are good and you know are all our operational metrics are are showing and with the festival season now starting uh uh you know the the growth is really picking up nicely so we remain quite optimistic about about uh about the next couple of quarters now I'll hand over to my colleague sanj to cover oil and gas business good evening everyone um just as a recap of the Quarter G byy so we recorded a a one of the the highest EIT in a quarter at 5290 Crowes with an healthy 85% ABA margin up 70 basis points quarter on quarter and almost 1300 basis points year on year mainly driven by Steady production from kg6 we continue to produce about 28.5 million standard cubic met and an upside in production from CBM that we've seen uh the multilateral wells that are currently being drilled and connected uh are giving us three to four times more productivity than the vertical Wells that we had drilled earlier so overall we're seeing a higher production in terms of price realizations year on Year yes the price is almost a do10 lower uh uh however quarter on quarter we've seen almost an upside of 30 uh 30 cents uh overall uh in we also saw a lowering of prices in CBM relative to last year but still at a Healy $11.40 per mmbtu um as such during the first half the ceiling price was at about $986 uh which has now been revised to $106 cents for the second half uh again this is just uh yeah you know we continue to remain a material contributor to India's gas economy we are sustaining the production at about 28.5 million standard cubic meters overall the outlook for demand and price looks good um the strong summer demand mainly the heat waves that were witnessed in China and India uh led to a 10% upside in demand um we've seen LG pric is almost 16% higher quarter on quarter at about $13 um again on the suppli side there were LG terminal outages mainly in the US and uh in Canada in Australia Malaysia and uh also the project maintenance activities uh that were undertake in in Norway Russia and Algeria uh overall the European demand has been more deid but as such what we see going forward is uh the prices should be supported or should remain elevated uh on the back of a delay in start up of new terminals um particularly in the US and Canada and also similarly we the feather gods are forecasting a potentially harsher winter with a high probability of Lina so overall we feel the prices should be much better also the ceiling price uh was will be higher at $106 per MMP Indian gas markets the demand remains very resilient quite robust in fact when compared to the first half of last fiscal versus the first half of this fiscal we have seen the demand go up to 202 million standard cubic meters versus 180 million standard cubic meters uh in last fiscal so mainly the demand has come from cgd and gas based power generation uh that is more or less about 60% of the incremental demand is come from there and this all boards very well for the the second half of this year uh we hope to have Improvement in CBM gas production steady gas production from kg D6 and higher prices in the second half thank you thanks s so on o2c revenues at close to a lak 56,000 crores of 5% and Aida 12,413 which was down 24% as you can see from the table Below in terms of where the margins were you can see year on year gasoline gas oil ATF all down about 50% when you look at Downstream chemicals apart from polypropylene you can see that most of them have been uh you know PE has been down 9% PVC even sharply lower with that 24% the whole polyester chain about 9% the same when you look at the quarter on quarter story also has been weak particularly L gasoline down 20% otherwise Downstream chemicals have been anywhere in the 6 to 8% lower so um that's been the broader environment and U the re so as you may recall one one one aspect was same time last year uh the cracks were pretty elevated as you know there were significant Supply disruptions uh one you know from from Russia from you know exports that were banned as well as some of outages in refineries um we also in this we are also seeing um you know Demand Being a weaker now uh as well as you know product Supply coming in from new refineries in uh in West Africa as well as in the Gulf overall Downstream chemicals have been weak U you know on the back of again uh um there's been a more I would say a weaker recovery in demand in a market which is pretty well supplied uh for from our point of view uh we compensated we try to compensate uh you know with the the fact that the benefit of coming from coming from Ethan cracking economics that that helped to negate some of this negative impact we also um on based on the improved domestic fuel economics uh you know that was profitable so we did see our own fuel retailing volumes up 28% on a year on-ear basis so in terms of broadly production meant for for sale has been flat slight increase in throughput so we have we we have been focusing on what we can really control in this quarter and uh you know some aspects where theing margin uh this continuous optimization within between PX and gasoline that continued and even though both of them were were weak in their own way but yes there was there was value in optimizing at different points in time we tried to maximize just not the overall thing but also the primary and secondary units in terms of utilization um from fuel cost point of view our gasifiers all of them worked nicely and uh therefore uh no really need for LG Imports we did one win the very prestigious award on this uh on Global Water Tech uh which was for smart water and water conserv and Waste Water Project this was for Jam Naga this is just the slide which talks about you can see that average bread prices were down 8% on a year and year basis as well as and about 6% QQ significant volatility that we have been seeing uh in in in all the oil prices as well as Downstream products um also at the same breath you can see that Ethan prices were pretty soft at 16 cents per gallon and this is down 47% year on year um in in the back of how us gas prices behaved as well as the higher availability of ethane and when you can see operating rates uh you know refinary operating rates at 79.2 down about almost close close to 2% lower as well as um but the operating rates for for crackers have been slightly higher at 80% when you look at overall demand you can see that for second quarter up8 million barrels per day year on year and the context being last time the same time it was up 2 and a half million barrels per day so you can see the difference and uh this growth has been primarily Asia ex China as well as you know developed markets in America when you look at Transportation fuel uh gasoline was higher at about 35 million barrels per day more you felt in Middle East and North America gas oil flat Koo Jet and K up by about3 million barrels per day mainly in Asia so I would say characterize it as a normalized demand across both oil as well as fuel Downstream on the domestic side you can see that it has it was demand environment was bit weak lower by that is oil demand was up to 2.2% but but lower on a quarter on quarter basis really led by gasoline at 7% Plus plus high speed diesel was flat and ATF up about 9% and uh you know really indicating trends for personal mobility and air travel that's that's keeping the gasoline and ATF Demand on the higher side on the polymer and polyester side both of them were weak in this quarter down 5% and 7% um other than PVC which was higher by about 3% L by agriculture both p uh was down 12% and it also was because it had a much higher base at the time we saw a significant increase same time in the last water on polyester demand P you know you have seen it's about 10% lower on the back of extended Monsoon and also on the polyester side both for fiber and Yar down on the back of lower activity in in the fabric Market when you look at cracks this is the 50% that I talked to you about for gas oil jet Koo and gasoline and uh you can see that again the context being you recall it was pretty elevated last time but also it was also couple compounded by the fact that demand has been weak and weak economic conditions in China has also played a part um q1q again has also been impacted by seasonal factors on for ATF uh ATF in way tracked gas oil cracks um but overall it remains uh kind of on a quarteron quarter basis was stable on the back of rise in air travel gasoline was more about continuing weak demand and also you know Rising EV penetration in China QQ was more from the higher runs in gasoline there uh in US so in Regional polymers overall Deltas you can see that uh um it was polymer deltas were down on weak demand um also when you look at the percentages it was down about 9% for p and % for polypropylene as producers struggled to pass on the higher fig stock prices PVC particularly Delta lower on the back of higher EDC prices and also the fact that you know absolute price of PVC itself was lower and on a quarter on quarter basis um you know again coming from the back of weakness coming on the back of Market which was very well supplied the ethane cracking economics versus NAFTA you know helped as you can see Ethan prices declined 18% while NAFTA prices declined only a% on a QQ basis on the overall polyester Delta you can see that it was down um 9% and primarily because of the impact on parazine Deltas that we saw on a quarter on quarter basis also it was lowered by about 3 % and uh again weakness in PX although though mg margins were were better on the back of uh lower inventory in China from uh from a when you look at the demand and margin environment the the point here is that uh overall demand for oil is expected to be a million barrels per day and this is coming on the back of strong growth that we saw of 2.1 million barrels per day in 23 um some of the factors in the near term could be if there are refiner Cuts in Europe and Asia on the back of the weakness that you are seeing in the refining margins um also jet demand could also see some growth uh typically um in third quarter which is coincide with a lot more of travel and in that more so you can see that coming in Asia which will account for 70% of the growth also um heating demand could be higher uh based on anticipation of of Colder Winters this time and um the other aspects which could play a part is uh Improvement in margins coming on the back of significant stimulus package in China you know that that's something that could have an impact on on overall demand India Downstream demand uh you know we do expect to benefit from the upcoming festive season and also the fact that cotton versus staple fiber Deltas are are very high and which makes it which makes a demand for psf quite likely here and on challenges side geopolitics continues to play a part you know OPEC policy has an impact um capacity addition and also some of the refineries that will come back these are normally the factors which have a play but uh you know it is a complex uh and vol world where many many aspects are playing its role and um also from from an India stand Point Downstream exports uh again if there is a slow down in demand in us and EU could have an impact so very complex set of Dynamics at play both for the demand and margin environment and the the volatility and cost because of the volatility of all these factors so uh just summarizing uh been recently earnings um you know um overall when you see strong upstream and Digital Services um largely offset muted muted OTC earnings here and uh clearly when you see from a cash flow point of view it remain strong and balance sheet and liquidity continues to be strong on the overall energy business side U you know price and margin Vol volatility on the back of geopolitics um you know is is is a is a continuing theme that we have been talking about and um uh some of the drivers on demand can you know can come on the back of some of the actions on economic stimulus as well as monetary policies stimulus and uh on the consumer side uh the focus on of course as dis talked about the upcoming festive season demand uh you know is at least started off well and uh our own focus on strengthening of operations that I talked about um orall so all of them on the tech platforms the streamlining there the calibrated approach to B2B so as the underlying theme thematic of the uh business continues to be well but for the next one or two quarters uh you know that is something it could be a little bit more U uh it's as as all these actions Works its way in the next couple of quarters post that you can see the whole we expect it to revert back to the industry leading momentum that that we have seen and uh what D talked about you can see that most of these we expect to be remain strong there so with this uh I come to the end of this presentation uh thank you so much and wishing everyone a very very happy Diwali and Sal Mubarak likewise thank you yeah"

      "transcript": "good evening and uh very happy New Year to uh all of you U very happy to welcome you to the third quarter Financial year 2025 business presentation from Reliance Industries limited um as always we have Shri Kant walking you through the Consolidated uh numbers first uh then uh we will have Karan talk about goo we will have anman talk about go numbers then we will have Dasa talk about retail and San R talking about our EMP performance then shant will come back and then summarize uh but before summarizing we'll also talk about our performance so thank you Sant and to thank thanks shini and Happy New Year to all of you we had a good operating quarter with strong performance in each of our segments uh Revenue growth every growth at close to 8% and a pat growth of close to 12% and um specifically the consumer businesses did well and so did OT Toc uh we had strong sequential performance uh in fact uh if you were to look at Aida on an aggregate basis uh sequentially up 9% uh retail was up 177% sequentially OTC was up 16% sequentially so strong Improvement there and um in each of the businesses retail uh and you know we'll go through the slides but it's on the back of strong festive season and good traction with our customers on Geo it the story is about higher aru and the fact that we are adding consumers especially in ftt h uh OTC year on year has been steady um backed by feed stock optimization and strong domestic demand and Upstream has been a steady performance uh just a one slide summary of the performance uh as you can see uh Revenue in Abida almost 19% higher on a year on year BAS is led by T benefit of tarf as you can see you know arpu at 203 rupees which is up 12% and also us adding almost 3.3 million subscribers during the quarter of which two have been for home so uh there has been this whole point about return of customers and a post transient from the Sim consolidation concern point of view data traffic very strong 22% higher at about 46 exabytes of data and also that 5G customer base is now 170 million number on retail side uh Revenue Abida and Pat between 9 and 10% and as I mentioned uh you know very strong sequential performance with revenues up actually on a on a sequential basis 18% and uh they about 17% and um uh uh the big you know we obviously benefited from an exceptionally strong festive season demand and as you may recall we have been talking about significant efforts over the past few quarters in terms of streamline streamlining our operations and the and the and the benefit out of that and the productivity gains that have come out especially when you look at grocery if you look at b2c that's a 37% growth there um and also benefiting from very strong uh Traction in our consumer brands uh in fashion and lifestyle we saw a very strong Rebound with some of our new formats uh uh delivering the highest ever sales uh digital benefited again from the festive and wedding season and evida margin continue to expand at 8.6% it's up 20% 20 basis points on a year on year basis uh this time we started Express Deliveries pilot in about 4,000 PIN codes and uh continuing footprint expansion 779 stores uh overall that we saw in OTC segment uh Abida growth about 2.4% year on year about 16% on a quarteron quarter basis on a year on-ear basis I would say it's a a study performance with a lot more focus on you know favorable feed stock sourcing it has also they also benefited from higher volumes it's up almost 9% you may recall that last time around there were uh large plan shutdowns in the in the same period last year and uh that rebound and volumes we saw uh importantly this time has also been big push towards uh in in our domestic fuel retailing and if you see the volumes volumes have been up 44% for gasoline and 23% for diesel the good news also has been the fact that domestic demand has been strong oil at almost close close to 6% demand growth polymer 11% and polyester 12 so in a way the mixed that we saw in as far as the margin environment was concerned based on global factors did get compensated by the push in the domestic side as well as the higher volumes that we had oil and gas steady quarter Revenue slightly lower because of volumes from kgd 6 being there but there was a bit of in terms of the price was slightly higher at about 8% higher at 9.74 a million btu overall production uh you know still the feel produces 28.4 mm CMD bring these numbers together overall you can see that Aid up 8% on a year on-ear basis and uh almost flowing through from into a pat at at 12% so benefit of all the each of the individual businesses doing well you see that this is just the bridge uh pictorially it tells you that on a year on-ear basis the big contribution coming from digital service Services which is up 2,400 crores so did retail adding 600 crores to the overall Abida and uh you know when we and thees will cover through some of the other operating metrics in terms of footfalls and number of transactions quarter on quarter big jump coming from OTC here um it is on the back of higher refiner refining margins as well as improved PP and PVC Deltas that we saw um otherwise even on OTC marginal Improvement in kgd 6 gas price realization you know benefited it retail benefited from the festive demand that I talked about and digital on the back of both you know aru increase as well as you know continuing migration to 5G as well as the GE a fiber connect that we saw uh flat in terms of net debt you can see that uh you know broadly the same as what it was in September and which is the same as what it was even in March so continuing strength of the balance sheet and our capex for the quarter was around 32,000 crores well below the cash profits of 38,000 that uh you know this quarter you know we have delivered with this uh I'm going to hand it over to Kiran thank you um thank you sh so we want to start today about with an update on the progression of our true 5G Services if you look at the chart on the right you can see that it has been a story of of study growth uh we already had the pan India Network up and running for the past many quarters and now thanks to the Natural upgradation of devices happening in the market where a lot of the new handsets have 5G capability and as soon as a customer acquires a 5G device they automatically are able to enjoy all of the 5G services available through ge2 5G so the combination of having that pan India network available uh and the increasing adoption of 5G devices in our subscriber base has resulted in the number of GE 5G subscribers Crossing 170 million as on December of 24 uh moreover 5G now accounts for a large chunk of the uh the traffic on our Network nearly 40% of the wireless traffic um of an overall traffic of about 15 exobytes is being contributed by 5G and the story will continue to unfold into the future uh and more interesting thanks to the to the fact that we have this superlative true 5G Network which is a big differentiator Vis other competitors also means that any new 5G device that is sold in the market 70% of them end up becoming a geoc customer and using Geo services so so literally I think we are at the cusp where probably in a very short period of time we'll be able to say that um in probably one of the fastest 5G rollouts not only 5G rollouts but 5G adoption anywhere in the world there total 5G traffic on our network will surpass the 4G traffic very very shortly now it is not just in the consumer side um we we have also been briefing all of you over the last few quarters about uh true 5G um also powering something called Geo air fiber so if you look at the pie chart on the left what is heartening is that the availability of air fiber has really opened up demand unlocked demand or pent of demand from Beyond what we call the top cities and towns of India and what we are seeing is that as you know you know nearly 70% of the population of of the country is uh is outside of the what we call the the cities or the urban markets and now we are really starting to see that even our addition with respect to air fiber connections are starting to reflect that mix and More than 70% of the new connections are now starting to come from Beyond the the top, towns and cities we also had U more than 2 million connects in a single quarter in the third quarter of F525 which has really driven the total connected premises to nearly 17 million uh and just keeping in mind that this SP is accelerating now as the roll out itself is kind of becoming almost a a well oil machine and and with new demand getting unlocked from from all across the country and not just the urban centers I think I think the pace of connections uh will pick up into the future and we see that this entire Greenfield opportunity of connecting 100 million plus homes across India uh is is now getting that additional momentum thanks to air F and and this is an area where we have a significant first mover Advantage where essentially we are going after either to unconnected or underserved markets with this off the Enterprise business is also uh picking up momentum if you look at year- on-ear growth there is a nearly three times or 280% year- on-ear increase in all the government large government tenders which have come out um and of course if you look at both the national and state government connectivity infrastructure We are continuing to increase our share uh in that uh in that segment um another big segment which is modernizing is all the banks and if you look at um the recent past again we we've been consistently winning a lot of the connectivity tenders coming from coopertive Banks and we believe that there's a potential to get up to 150,000 Bank branches across the country uh that we are well positioned to connect eventually uh and of course large corporates across as as some of their traditional contracts are rolling off we are getting selected as almost near exclusive service provider because most Enterprises who have multiple locations and pan India premise presence they're looking to have a single solution provider and go is well positioned to to be that exclusive service provider on a pan India basis and wherever we have such demand coming in we are we are we are seeing that we are we are the provider of choice there in addition to connectivity again we are providing a true developer friendly platform assess service for connectivity we call know connect connectivity and communication platform as a service the brand name is gox and in addition to that of course um the iot adoption again which requires pan India connectivity and of course in the government sector through a few of the initiatives and vins that we have had also getting into private and uh hybrid Cloud as a managed service so across the board I think connectivity is obviously getting strengthened but we are also now starting to see traction for services Beyond connectivity and also talking about communication we launched recently the SI business and and and we are seeing a 50% growth in the installed base in the first quarter itself post launch uh if you look at the what what is now I just want to talk about a few themes that we are pursuing into the future so certainly we are living in the age of AI dramatic Transformations starting to happen across Industries across functions across even across um you know various use cases uh and and to any able all of that to happen and making sure that India is you know emerging as one of the preeminent AI Nations anywhere in the world again we see ourselves having to pursue a few missions to support that ambition and the first one is of course setting up national truly National AI infrastructure um really looking at creating AI ready infrastructure hard infrastructure and compute capabilities not just in the few megawatts or even hundreds of megawatts but really extending into the gwatt scale because we believe that this transformation will be like across the board and we need to be ready to ramp up and support the emergence of AI driven use cases in in the in the country and not just creating the scale but also ensuring that we are able to deliver through various Innovative uh Partnerships and of course Innovative initiatives internally to deliver one of the lowest cost inference capabilities when it comes to AI anywhere in the world uh and this is a similar Mission as compared to what we were able to do in Broadband so very excited by that uh internally I think we are seeing already multiple use cases where we are starting to weave that AI story across our operating companies in the Reliance group um and of course on the back of whatever we are doing here eventually we will be then looking to offer this as a platform even for other Enterprises in India and if you're looking at uh what other offerings Beyond a platform play what other offerings we are looking to take to market across theard all of the the consumer and small businesses and Enterprise offerings that we already providing in the market all of them will see a lift thanks to the adoption of AI within all of those applications as well through multiple use bases um looking at some of the AI related um not just AI but across across the board comprehensive sweet of offerings that we unveiled in in in the India mobile Congress 2024 which happened over the last quarter I think building on the AI theme a platform called geob brain which is really the the plumbing on top of which we are able to rapidly spin up all of these AI use cases that I spoke about that was unveiled and and and uncased uh we made an announcement and now it is available through a beta offering um called uh AI Cloud which is again an offering for the consumer so that was also um announced and showcased and now um taking compute into the homes which has always been an underserved Market again partly because homes are not connected but part partly also because of the high cost of having personal computers uh in the home so now we are we showcased a solution called geoc Cloud PC which is effectively and I I'll talk about that in in in a slide shortly but effectively a very low cost and pay as you go um capability of having a personal computer green personal computer never needed to be upgraded always the latest specs and pay as you go you only pay for the the time for which you are using that PC um again Services uh for Education again using AI to power various I would say personalized education use cases AI for skill development again how do you train Beyond primary education but once you get into the workforce how do you use AI to continuously stay updated some use cases around how can farmers and other uh people involved in the agricultural um sector use AI uh and then of course um many vertical focused Solutions especially when it comes to hospitality retail nursing and and and so on um and of course unveiling A New U new Benchmark when it comes to providing gigabit speed connectivity to every SMB so a combination of services but a but a increasing contribution being made by AI Ross all of these Services some of them are already in the market and some of them we will be announcing the offerings uh being made available in the market very shortly uh now coming to the go AI Cloud offering that I spoke about this is really a combination of putting connectivity putting cloud storage and AI into one package and making it available to Indian customers connectivities are given I think I mentioned both in the hand and in the home that connectivity story is really unlocking new demand but at the same time 100gb free of cost I think the earlier Benchmark was either 5gb or 15gb depending on whether you were an Apple customer or Google customer through Android but we kind of RA the bar multi to store to share to sync secure even stream various kind of media assets all from the same app without having to use any other applications um unlocking the the content that you have onto the Big Screen through through integration with our setop box trying to bring in additional content very easily like an integration with things like digilocker where if you have even government authenticated content and documents very easy to integrate between your a cloud and that or other events or other occasions ability to group individuals through face detection multiple magic tools to convert your photographs into out other other assets into the into into those content all of that today already made available and we've just launched this as a beta offering in the market and the geoc cloud PC that I mentioned earlier so really this is again a new frontier of adding adding to the to the lineup of Digital Services that we are taking to Indian homes uh the key idea being that we already have a pretty capable set of box in the home uh so effectively we are converting that set of box and your TV into a PC Because the actual compute we are able to run in the cloud uh and then all you need is a keyboard and a mouse and effectively your your setop box and your TV in combination with the with the cloud PC doubles up as a as a PC Available to You On Demand uh and really I think the key power that we're looking to um looking to provide to the home is to uh enable multiple work and learn and create use cases so certainly students today uh not just U for their classwork but to develop skills like coding or media creation Etc beyond what they're learning in their classroom certainly would require compute of some kind and and this we believe is going to be that gig workers who are working from home Etc again they are creators of content and sometimes the phone or the tablet is not the best form factor for productive work and again this could unlock many such use cases and again we are providing 100gb of storage for with with every cloud PC and uh as a basic capability an 8GB multicore processor is already available through the cloud to get you started and again like I said U it is always updated both in terms of hardware and software because all of that is in the cloud you don't have to really think about buying or upgrading that on your own um and there's no lockin um there is there is no maintenance or anything um it's always available to you and you only pay for what you use so some updates uh that I had and I'll just hand it over to now anim to talk about both the oper and financial numbers for the thanks K of all wish everyone a very happy New Year coming to the quarterly highlights uh both combination of tariff fight as well as scale up of some of the digital platforms and and improving customer mix resulted in our on there and some of the digital revenues just about kicking in subscriber base uh at 4.82.1 million so we've uh as K mentioned ear on we started getting our uh the the subscriber run and and addition revenues coming in from some Digital Services um home additions home uh we had uh we added almost 2 million new connections during the connected and which will be fairly you know the rate at which we growing we should be the largest air Fiber service provider globally in a um in in the next few months customer engagement continues to be very strong um 350 GB per capita monthly data usage and that also continues to grow quarter by quarter um Chinese companies as well on the ARP PR PR in aru um there's been a significant increase in aru over the over the last few years 5e raised 10% the full impact of the July 24 tari height part of that impact has already played through in the last two quarters but full impact still playing out as as most of you are aware we have subscribers who are on longer term plans and who tend to uh recharge over a longer period of time and therefore we expect some of some more flow through to happen as well and U you know the the uh affordability as well as increasing engagement uh should sustain both the subscriber growth run rate as well as the aru growth in the in the coming quarters as well as you know a bunch of new services and Facilities K spoke about a few of those plus the media offerings that we're providing to our customers we expect to G gain larger uh further improve the customer wallet share that we have the key operating matrices that we report to you every quarter 4821 million subscribers net custom addition of 3.3 million during the quarter so the we clearly saw a reversal of Trend that we had seen in the last quarter and an increasing run rate of customer addition uh r at 23.3 rupes um the total data consumption cross 46 xaby for the quarter that continues to grow fairly healthily 32.3 GB per user per month um net subscriber addition of 3.3 million um sorry that we saw up the voice uh per capita voice consumption also continues to grow uh over 1,000 minutes per user per month of of voice so data and voice traffic grew 22.2% and 6.5% respectively on a year-on-year basis coming to the RG financials these are financials for our connectivity business uh the operating revenues grew to 29,37 CR that was a 15.5% year- on-ear increase um and the Abida growing a little bit faster coming to 15798 cres the Abida margin at 53.9% this is only for the connectivity business rjil the connectivity service provider and coming to the key financials for geo platforms limited uh consolidated financials U the overall Q3 revenues came in for at 3374 uh 19.4% year on-year growth uh we saw a very healthy or we are seeing a very healthy increase in non-connectivity the digital revenues which grew at 60% year on year the annualized Run rate has crossed 15,000 and U this we are seeing very healthy growth Trend year coming com in with most of the growth coming in from new new customers that that we able to serve a bidda increase to 16585 Consolidated Abida um so the conso Abida margin at 50.1% and profit after tax at 6857 that was a healthy 26% year-on-year growth during the quarter with this I'm going to hand over to den to take you through the results operating and financial results for liance retail thanks Anan hi good evening everyone on the retail business uh we had a very strong performance with 90,000 crores of Revenue during the quarter so Milestone quarter for us the

continues to contribute or the contribution has has remained steady at about 18% uh we opened 779 new stores du during the quarter uh the total store count stands at 19 global luxury retailer uh also in order to further strengthen the IP we did a joint venture with Mother Care PLC uh where we own a majority stake in the SPV which owns the mother care brand for the Indian subcontinent now that gives us ownership of the IP and gives us a lot more flexibility to uh to expand the range uh Source locally as well as improve the margin so uh it is quite a positive for us quick summary Revenue uh at 90,000 crores Eid at 6,800 crores and profit after tax of 3500 crores so as you can see very strong growth sequentially as well as on a Yi basis uh moving on to uh the the some of the highlights across key businesses uh electronics business had strong growth during the quarter this was the festive and wedding quarter where we see a lot of pickup and demand uh we had a strong 6% lfl uh growth uh our average bill values continue continue to grow uh as well as conversions are conversion rates of of of people coming to the stores is also also improving uh we had a strong festive quarter uh one what we measure the one week leading up to Diwali uh we had a strong 12% of growth on a YY basis rescue which is the largest service Organization for electronics and our biggest differentiator uh that continues to expand uh as you would recollect we had launched on demand Services three quarters back we added it to 75 75 new cities where we offer this service and now we are present in 225 cities uh for the services and overall we are present in over a thousand plus cities our own Brands business Contin us to launch new products there were several launches which were done during the

only 15% comes from our own own channels uh our B2B GMD business continues the growth momentum uh mobile phones continues to lead uh be the dominant category in this business and we are seeing both increase in merchant participation as well as the wallet share of merchant Partners is going which this business uh would increase substantially uh on the appar and Footwear business we had a very uh very strong B bounce back uh partly the festival season but also a lot of hard work that we had been doing on on you know enhancing our design capabilities uh improving the the the supply chain the design to shelves shortening the design to shelves cycle using technology and AI uh and improving the inore customer experience all of that is coming together and uh driving this growth uh we are also adding new categories into our stores adjacencies so Beauty and seaware uh we as as categories we have added across multiple store formats uh our three recent store formats which we launched last year uh they continue to scale well and the customer adoption is is strong uh we had the highest ever sales on all these formats uh during this quarter our own Brands continue to grow and and their share continues to increase uh aasa netl dnmx these are the our three largest Brands uh they are the they they they're the amongst the leading brands in their respective categories and uh they do drive a lot of footfall in our stores a Geo business the focus has been on on you know improving the economics and improving the average bill values and premiumize the offering uh so that continues to do well uh we have amongst the highest average bill values amongst all on online fashion Platforms in the country the average bill value was up 7% on a YY basis uh we added uh almost 2 million uh customers uh during the quarter uh we continue to expand our catalog and we added over half a million options just in the first N9 months of this year the total catalog now stands at 2.2 million uh in this you know you have to provide customers a wide range as well as exclusive uh exclusive brand so so most of our our our own brands that we have uh whether whether partner brands or or our in-house Brands they're exclusive on the quarter on Forever 21 and soy being some of the some of the few uh the Black Friday sale event uh we had strong performance there was a 17% growth Y and when we look at you know the number of people we are reaching the iBall because the campaign reach was up 300% which is a significant increase because it's a increasing the awareness of the platform and helping us Recruit new customers a premium Brands business uh know steady steady performance driven by the the by the festive demand again uh we uh continue to strengthen our portfolio and launch new brands so on the in the FNB portfolio we had PR and we had launch Armani Cafe last quarter uh this quarter we launched the Elan Cafe uh as well as in the in the in the premium women's site we launched the Sandro brand uh we also signed the India franchise for S sax F venue to Target the super luxury segment uh in addition the IPS that we own right we own we have stakes in a lot of designer Brands we are taking them Global uh so for instance Rahul Mishra and AK by namika kanana uh we have taking them to us uh through our Partnerships with saxs where they will be present in the iconic saxs New York store uh Hamley is a is a tourist destination driven business in in especially in Europe uh we set up our third store in in in in Italy and we continue to expand in in New Markets uh we spoke about the uh mother care IP uh Jewels overall SE overall I think the jewelry business has been kind of volumes have been impacted by uh the substantial increase in gold prices uh we had uh we had a decent quarter especially dantas in wedding season uh where we did have a lot of footfalls and and and reasonable growth in sales uh we also continue to launch new collections uh soam collection is meant towards the towards the wedding season and we have done multiple uh multiple phases of that you know variants of that collection over the periods and this is a property that we' buil uh b2c uh grocery was the star the the b2c business had a very strong 37% growth The Big Box formats are are kind of driving this growth uh there is broad-based growth across categories the high margin categories general merchandise and value apparel as well as some of the premium categories in personal and home care and Beauty continue to do very well uh we are continuously improving our assortment and premiumize the benefit of that is one it provides a differentiation uh for us in terms of customers getting uh the thar ready stale sale aaki property that we have built targeting the festive season uh there are various festive categories which which did very well and remember these are footfall Cate footfall driver categories during the festival season Metro which is a B2B business delivered its highest ever Festival sales uh this business is scaling up very nicely uh we had a bunch of you know local events targeting various occasions uh to really Drive engagement with the merchin kirana partners uh online grocery I think uh three prong one is the Express Deliveries so so that's something that we are accelerating our presence the big Advantage we have is uh we have stores across the length and breadth of the country we are today providing Express Deliveries uh across 4,000 pin Cod through a network of 2,100 Plus stores spread across a large spectrum of cities uh from where we are able to deliver uh within 30 to 45 minutes uh from our from our from our stores and we looking to Crunch that timeline even further uh compared to any other uh any other e-commerce there the big Advantage we have is that we ride on the existing infrastructure uh from a customer value proposition they get much wider assortment uh we don't charge delivery fee and a host of other other other benefits in terms of best pricing in the industry so there's a very strong proposition for the customer and for us the unit economics are much better than anybody else uh given that we are we are we are leveraging the existing Network rather than incurring a setting up a high cost dedicated Network for this business also given the width of offering we have our our AOE are are amongst the highest in the industry uh because we are able to offer the full range of grossery general merchandise Electronics fashion that really helps us drive the average order values uh the second part is the is the subscription business uh we continue to grow this business very nicely it's a premium service business where we we people actually pay for delivery and you have to gr micro Market by micro Market capture it City by City And we are steadily uh increasing the presence of this business uh the third part is you know these are our our inventory Le models uh to fill any gaps so that a customer can have the widest Choice uh we continue to add 3p sellers so we can offer the entire range to the to the customers and we continue to add new sellers onto the platform uh and there was a big push on the Festival event uh to acquire customers as well as as push new categories and you know during the festival season we saw one and a half X growth in in gmv during that period consumer Brands uh uh businesses is scaling up exponentially uh in the 9 months FY 25 this is our fmcg business uh we had revenues of towards of 8,000 crores uh two of our our most prominent Brands campine Independence they continue to gain traction each one of them individually should cross a th000 crores per over in FY 25 Campa has already gained 10% market share in the sparking with bage category in in select States uh the focus here is three promp expand distribution in the priority States uh strengthen our product portfolio uh through you know inovative products and and and and Partnerships products which are meant for the Indian market for the Indian consumer that differentiates us from competition uh as well as build a robust supply chain where I can have the widest Presence at the lowest Supply that going forward quarter on quarter uh we should we should we should show Healthy Growth uh coupled with all the all the you know all the productivity improvements that we with that I'll hand over to Sanjay for oil and gas business thanks d very good evening to all of you and a very happy new New Year uh just as a recap of the quarter gone by so this was the steady quarter we saw Revenue at about 744 million about 6370 crores uh which is a slight uh upside from the previous quarter of two of around 2 and a half% a bit came in at about 5,565 cres uh again about more than 5% increase quarter on quarter uh a bit of margins were very healthy it grew by almost 240 basis points to 87.4% uh the key drivers uh uh you know we saw an optic in CBM production based on multilateral Wells uh currently 34 Wells have been put on stream out of the 40 originally planned Wells um so we are seeing a production of about 35 million standard cubic meters uh which is quite encouraging U and the the perspective is that we will continue to drill Mar lateral Wells as this these are highly Capital efficient and delivering better results kg D6 performance has been steady in terms of production about um uh in overall BCF term 68.5 at on uh on M cndd term we are about 28.4 million s cubic meters and about 21,000 barrels of condensate per day now uh the marginally lower production has been offset by higher price realizations in kg6 uh again the ceiling price prevailing during this half is $106 per dollar per mmbt as and we are realizing slightly higher values in uh which is $974 uh in CBM uh We've realized about 10.58 which is lower you know but still quite healthy uh the difference being here quarter on quarter prices were far elevated you know when we look at a year back um in terms of the battle uh condensate battle realization uh we seeing about 75.2 4 which is lower simply on the back of lower brand prices uh prevailing during the quarter so just to review the Outlook of the gas markets um again prices during the quarter forward around 13 to15 per mmbtu mainly the demand has been in resilient particularly in India overall in the shortterm uh we expect prices to remain firm uh there are delays in the LG projects the pl means about 5 million tons in uh in the C in c25 um also we see the storage is uh at much lower level levels in Europe um we're seeing about 68.8% versus fiveyear averages of 74.8 but if you compare it to last year it was almost 84% so so storage is at much lower level so you expect higher European gas demand again BS well for elevated prices going forward the Indian gas market has remained extremely robust uh in fact in in cy24 we we saw a significant increase in consumption almost by 10% uh it almost uh it went up to almost 200 million standard cubic meters in the last quarter um mainly driven by City Gas Distribution Refinery and petam and power sectors um LG Imports also saw a surge uh despite elevated prices uh we saw the uh overall consump uh demand for lmg go up to almost 25.5 million tons perom as comp uh in uh in cy24 as compared to 21.1 million tons uh in cy23 so that was quite an increase in demand despite higher prices um also uh given ceiling price is uh better uh $106 uh 16 per mmbtu us compared to the first half which was $990 uh8 $987 it BS well for the price outlook for the current quarter thank you so um as you saw the aid for this quarter 14,400 crores up 2.4% on a year on year and uh of course we benefited from higher volumes that's up 9% um we benefited from the fact that uh you know there was strong Dom also the continuing advantage of of NAFTA of Ethan cracking versus NAFTA uh you know as you know the cost are almost $300 one and 9% across these products uh while fuel cracks were uh were healthy it did come off significantly from what it was last year so and um also it offsets the polyester chain margins which are lower on a you know on a year on year basis by 12% uh and that benefited from recovery in mid distillates especially gas oil and ATF were up 11 to 133% polypropylene price margins improved by 160 basis points to 99.6% and um you know we continue to focus on some of the things uh you know we do in terms of for example in the case of prioritizing automatics and given as you know the given the environment for aromatics it made sense for us to to to prioritize production of Transportation fuel as I mentioned we we focused a lot on domestic fuel sales given the demand also a lot of cost optimization measures in as far as uh you know using larger vehicles for delivering for lowering our freight cost for product placement also uh focused a lot of attention and using fo for uh for minimizing of fuel cost for the jamnagar complex during periods when there were lower availability so quick snapshot Market environment uh you know average Brent crud prices when you look at it 11% fall year on year 7% down on a quarteron quarter basis you know on the back of stronger dollar uh weakness in in China and uh you know non-op production which kept the markets fairly well supplied um us Ethan prices were lowered by 3% year on year benefiting us from because of cracking Ethan uh and also the Opera rates in the US were higher this time because of you know the some of the crackers which were under shutdown came back into production oil demand uh still is 1 and a half million higher on a year on-year basis primarily led by Asia X Japan as well as we saw uh EU Demand Being higher and also the fact that gas prices were firm helped keep the demand for oil also firm and on the transportation fuel side um gasoline demand we saw was up about 4.4 million barrels uh at about 26.9 diesel was broadly flat and jeto demand was actually Higher by 0.5 million about 8 8 million barrels per day and primarily Asia Pacific contributing for more than half of it the uh of course for third quarter of the benefit as I talked about earlier was domestic demand was up 9.6% at about 10 million tons on the back of demand for PV uh you know two wheer sales you saw a lot of momentum there in in passenger vehicles uh from for us the focus uh was on really pushing domestic sales as you saw as I mentioned retail volumes are up 44% it are supported by some specific schemes like AP petrol scheme uh and as I mentioned you know our prioritizing of gasoline versus automatics meant that we had more volume to sell in gasoline newterm Dynamics you know we think that near time Outlook given Chinese spring festival and Ramadan could keep the uh near time Outlook positive on diesel again the weakness we saw attributable to China as well as the inventories were higher quarter on quarter the prxs did improve to 15.1 on the back of lower China exports and India demand and domestic demand year on year is up 5% at about 24 million tons for us similar to gasoline Focus has been on stronger domestic product placement and uh and specifically in India we saw ATF grew by 9% on a year and year basis and for us if you look at what air DP and uh newterm Dynamics again look positive with Chinese newer and as well as the mahak in India is could possibly support demand Focus has been the benefit has come because of uh you know higher use of the assets that we had and uh you know benef we tried to maximize light feed cracking so um near term near term demand continues to be good for p when it when you look at uh you know demand for packaging and uh the of course the broad know was uh Deltas were up 9% uh domestic demand pretty strong 16% growth that we saw asset availability uh PVC uh the Delta has improved by 12% year on year that was mainly on the back of falling EDC prices uh specifically for p pvcr actions have been on you know more on freight cost reduction uh emphasis on premium grades that's what we have we focused and uh overall demand uh demand for PVC is continues to remain supported because of agre and infrastructure growth while while Downstream polyester margins did improve it did pull the overall chain Delta 12% lower the strong festive demand that we margins and uh on a more on that the cotton versus psf that margins continue to be good so longterm I mean you know that that so you just put all these thing together uh you can see that even though Deltas have been mixed in fact a lot of arrows downwards um but uh by the fact that uh we had volume increases uh in each of these products as well as the fact that the domestic demand has been pretty so I just wanted to lay the context and you as you can see the last 5 years have seen significant reductions in margins anywhere between 30 to 70% across refining polymer polyester and uh and at the same time it is also has come with significant volatility in these earnings uh we know the factors it was Co it was it has been large capacity additions it has been war in Ukraine um it has been the war in the Middle East so this has been the broader environment so again in that context uh if you see our own um margins uh our own performance as you can see the our performance has been I would say very resilient and with also lower volatility and uh the the Investments that we made in light feed cracking preo be it Ethan sourcing and shipping or building the refinery off gas cracker that has ensured that we have had significantly better economics than what is implied by the NAFTA based margins of the previous slide we also if you may recall our gasification investment uh you know came in it contributed very positively when LG markets were dislocated after the Ukraine war also the continuing focus on the high growth domestic Market uh in in the domestic petrochemical Downstream and you know these markets have grown anywhere between 8 and 10% so that has also meant for us higher asset utilization as well as margins and when you think about it when you go going into the future our capital investment plan that you know I will talk through in the next slide or two and the return to midcycle margins and refining and petrochemicals does make us have a constructive view on OTC growth into the future so before getting into the expansion projects it just it'll be helpful to see what is happening in terms of these two products uh I'll not go through in detail but except to say that when you look at polymers across P PP PVC and where it is going be packaging automobiles infra Agri healthcare for each of them if you look at the demand drivers and that is something that is extremely visible for to all of us package products food ordering the growth of retail and e-commerce when it comes to packaging in automobiles you seeing vehicle sales you know the demand for personal mobility and the need for lightweighting ETC on infrastructure side you can see the thrust on infrastructure project you know it is propelling C demand and therefore packaging there and uh again higher electricity consumption again making the need for wires and cables agree focus on micro irrigation government schemes all of them are playing a big part in terms of having uh the uh the demand for these products on a healthare again lot of awareness and lot of demand so as even if you were to look in the um longer term perspective last three year demand volume growth has been closer to 10% and more importantly in looking into the future this kind of demand environment remains uh intact on the polyester side between p and psf if you look again in terms of applications beverages textiles uh home furnishing it's we have been very focused in each of this projects on Capital allocation um our we have always invested at the bottom of the cycle and this is on flexibility on integration on newer Technologies uh will remain as we invest in these projects so against this if you see what are we investing in and you know starting with vinyes with this 1.5 million tons PVC and CPVC facility at the and nagot uh this uh as you know cat to a growing and a large deficit Indian market tracking and uh you know for us we are expanding the virtual ethane pipeline we we currently have three ships and you know we're adding three more BCS um to and that will help enhance the cost competitiveness of our cracker and uh you know the on finally on the on the polyester side with a million tons of specialty poly capacity and matched by 3 million tons of PTA will help sustain the uh growing demand there so when you look at it together uh you know some of the some of our points about having high quality asset which are which are uh vertically integrated and having the diversification of products and uh you know with cost profiles being in the top 10 or top quartile when you look at it for either be Refinery or Cracker and combine that with the market presence in India and the Deep distribution that we have uh the financial flexibility for us in terms of existing business with throw up cash helps us invest in this down cycle and uh uh so these three things uh therefore when you when put this together the point I was making about being constructive on OTC growth into the future is something that we see we see this business that on that trajectory just summarizing all the presentations that have done been thus far so we had uh record Consolidated earnings we saw both year onye as well as sequential and um with Now consumer businesses accounting for 52% of our segment debit on the energy side uh domestic Market remains very strong and with all the momentum in economic activity and also there has been recovery in fuel cracks with stronger demand in APAC regions including India and um the the fact that our operating model mitigated impact of weak Downstream margin environment on consumer side uh uh strong festive and wedding season demand but importantly you know I had been emphas izing over the last that we have over the last few quarters had focused a lot on operational um streamlining and all that you are starting to see the benefit and uh we remain confident about uh that it is behind us and uh you know the the constructive outlook for retail uh is very much now intact and goo is a you know value from you know you're are seeing the benefit of the Tariff hies and you're seeing the very strong traction on the customer addition site both and especially on homes and also the broader Digital Services earnings growth which was touched upon so overall it has been as I said a strong operating quarter and and and strong performance across all our businesses thank you"

million square feet so clearly uh you know we are the first Indian company to cross these Milestones on Standalone basis if you were to look JPL and rvl at this level U you know would be among the top 20 and top top 30 companies respectively uh looking at 23 24 U are Abida lak and 79,000 crores up 16% year on year we delivered net profit of 79,000 crores up 7.3% when you look at our consumer business um theida now close to 880,000 crores you know which is up almost 17% year on year 5 years cagr for our consumer business at 30% um and this has been enabled on the back of larger physical and digital footprint increase in footfalls the increase in the number of transactions increase in the number of subscriber registered subscribers on 5G it is on the back of higher customer engagement uh you know 5G roll out and ftth penetration and this has obviously been aided by significant operational flexibility you know focus on feed stock optimization light feed cracking and uh uh High domestic placement helped us overcome uh the you know the challenging environment on the oil and gas uh LED entirely by rampup in kgd 6 production um are balance sheet net debt has been falling and the capex trend also has been lower in all in all we have delivered you know Reit has doubled in in The Last 5 Years just key highlights here you can see that for retail our Revenue up 18% R up 29% um we have seen margin expansion at 8.4% which is 60 basis ponds higher as I mentioned food Falls greater than a billion which which is 36% higher 300 million registered customers we have now overall store addition has been uh 796 new stores um area under operation 79.1 so that's an expansion of almost 21% there uh our own fashion and lifestyle brands are now driving growth three brands have more

base and we are now rolling out GE a fiber in in 5,500 t on o2c side you Aida at [Music] between 20 and 45% has been the fall and it has been you know offset by lower Saad um also the environment you know when you look at some of the downstream petrochemical Deltas they are all multi- Decay lows on the back of Supply orine uh what's uh we have been able to offset uh this week margin environment by by focusing on on on light light feed cracking on focusing on feed stop uh sourcing and optimization and of course it was we held by the fact that the domestic demand environment has been pretty strong um you know for example on polymer side we have seen a 14% increase in demand year onye basis oil and gas the story uh 20,1 191 crores this is really the highest uh um evida that we have reported um this is uh up about 49% this is on the back of kgd 6 production which in itself was up 57% bringing these numbers together Revenue at 10 lakh crores uh um you know up 2.6% and the revenue growth is muted because as you may have observed that oil prices declined by 13 and a half% you know on a year on-ear basis and um overall when you see uh um Aid growth of 16 it was you saw that uh other than OT Toc the other businesses had strong uh growth um PBT at was about 11.4% as I mentioned it was one lakh CR mark it crossed um overall net profit was up 7.3% even though PBT was up 11.4% because uh as you may recall in the last year you know we did aail of uh took aail of all the tax credit that were available and now we are back to normal tax uh with this uh um this is the bridge on Aida contribution um really led by oil and gas on volumes retail because of categories and margin expansion Digital Services on the back of strong subscriber growth and operating leverage and others really reflect contribution from other businesses higher treasury income and and and a focus on cost which has helped us reduce some of the unable expenses this is uh moving to the fourth quarter numb stand alone uh the bidda at 47150 up 14% And net profit of 21,243 uh which is really flat on a year-on-year basis and uh as I was mentioning uh revenue is up because we saw double digit growth in both OTC and uh consumer business um every we have seen the contribution from across across businesses and particularly big growth in kgd 6 related deida um overall net profit profit was muted only because of the fact that you know we availed of the tax credits particularly in the fourth quarter of last year um however when you see the quarter on quarter you can see there is a sharp increase and that is primarily coming because of um OTC where post maintenance and inspection we saw an increase in volumes um also when you look at the individual net profits you can see that JPL is actually for the quarter is 5,600 crores rrel is about close to 2,700 crores so strong evida growth you know we have a portfolio of very Dynamic businesses which are doing well this is just the bridge and you can see that the biggest contribution here is uh um um on a year on-year basis coming from oil and gas and and all the other businesses have also done uh well here this is fourth quarter versus third quarter so sequential big jump as I was highlighting 2713 coming on the back of uh the fact that all units are operational post the mni turnaround uh we also saw uh sustained performance um with uh with marginal declines in in volume there and uh on on on the retail side store rationalization and seasonally affected this performance Digital Services you know we had 11 million customer addition in this quarter which which primarily drove the earnings there and on the balance sheet side uh you can see that net debt is low down by 10,000 crores it was 126,000 crores in March 23 now down to 116 and you can also note that the capex for the year is lak 32,000 uh which is about um you know last time it was 142 so um uh there has been a 10,000 CR deduction in capex as well as the fact that the capex for the year um you know if you compare it to the cash profits of a lak 42,000 crores so um the capex is is lower than the cash profit that we have and uh clearly this is uh you know we we had talked about keeping net debt a bit below one and at these levels it will be about 65 and um you know going forward uh this kind of Valance sheet provides parallel Financial flexibility and uh you know we'll continue to keep track of these ratios with this uh uh I'm giving it to Kiran yeah thank you SRI so let's start the update on the Digital Services piece with our true 5G Network um as on date uh more than 100 million in fact 108 million subscribers have migrated to Geo's 25g Services uh and if you look at the the total traffic that is now being carried or or being contributed by these 5G subscribers on a 5G Network it is now approaching 30% of the Mobility data traffic cumulative Mobility data traffic just keep in mind that it is just about a year and a half since we actually started rolling out our 5G Network and these are staggering numbers for such a short period of time uh in terms of quality as well ukla who is um always monitoring the quality of various Mobility Services especially in our 5G services in India Okla has rated go 5G the best network in terms of pretty much every metric uh availability latency normal data consumption video quality across the board on pretty much every parameter that they monitor Gio is now number one as a result you see on the infographic on the right um India is one of The Shining lights across the globe with a with a 100% m near 100% coverage uh of the landmarks of the country uh using the most advanced 5G services available globally which is the Standalone 5G and it also means that Gio on its own today has the world's largest 5G subscriber Base outside of China so China obviously has a head start they have been rolling out 5G for now nearly approaching five OD years uh but in just about an year and a half we have reached the number two position uh just and just behind China uh in terms of subscriber share as well so all of these factors including obviously our 4G network but now with 5G kicking in in in in full gear uh we continue to gain subscriber share uh if you look at just over the last uh year or so if you take March 23 position versus what we have in in in just a month back we have seen a nearly 3% increase in subscriber market share and this is not just in any one part of the country or the other it is across all circles whether it's a Metro Circle whether it is category a b or c Circle across all Circle categories we have seen a strengthening in our subscriber market share numbers uh and it's largely also driven by the fact that now we have one of the world's best uh 5G networks U working at scale uh and of course there are a number of U uh very interesting Partnerships that we've been able to create with premium smartphones because 5G and premium smartphones kind of go hand in hand because the true power of a smartphone is showcased by our 5G Network and and the other way around so all of these engines firing would mean that we are strengthening our Market leadership uh and this is a story that will continue to unfold into the future as well just a small uh infographic I think uh if you can play that animation this is just showing how our 5G network over the last like I said 80 OD months has really come alive uh and the real picture to take over uh take from this infographic is the fact that it is not a regional phenomenon it is not a big city phenomenon if you look at pretty much across the landmarks of India you can see that now our 5G network is present and and the growth in 5G adoption is largely now dictated only by the adoption of 5G smartphones otherwise our network is now present across the country we have seen growth in in in in subscriber base like I said across all Circle categories so this is just an infographic that gives you a visual appe visual feel for what that Journey has been now turning to our uh the other dimension of uh how our 5G network is helping bringing Broadband to uh India this is on our fixed Wireless strategy to go after homes and other fixed premises we used to have a what we call the geofiber story which has obviously been growing slowly but steadily over over the past many years but again now with Geo air fiber coming in we can we are in a position today to offer our fiber like Broadband uh through Geo air fiber to nearly 6,000 towns across the country uh and again uh what is very heartening to see is that the the air fiber availability is really translating into a very very healthy demand uh not only in the big big cities but we are seeing that more adoption is actually coming from tier 2 towns uh because that has been the area where the demand has been the greatest but uh reaching optical fiber to those towns has been time consuming but now with Geo air fiber available in thousands of cities that's really where we are seeing the the strongest adoption and of course just like with geofiber even geoair fiber comes with a a a a a suite of digital content bundled with the tariff plan uh that that subscribers sign up for uh and all of that is really translating into a very strong engagement as well so not just adoption but usage in terms of almost a per capita monthly consumption of nearly 400 GB which like approaching you know half a terabyte per month kind of a usage on geoair fiber and this increased distribution and presence means that our home strategy will also see now uh an accelerating momentum into the future uh coming to small businesses which is also one of the other uh segments which has been hither to underserved because they also are another category of fixed premises uh so like we uh speak about media bundling when we are going to these small businesses what we are actually talking about is a whole bundle which is relevant for businesses so if you look to the right everything from connectivity through fiber and air fiber uh in inside their offices or premises we are offering an NN managed Wi-Fi service uh and in key four key segments which are very large segments in in in the country if you take for example hotels or small manufacturers or schools and colleges and hospitals these are four very specific categories that we have selected where we are also taking very interesting software solutions to that market on our own and through Partnerships so for example if you take hotels in addition to connectivity and Wi-Fi um we are offering a an entire hotel management solution which also bundles in entertainment for the guests who are coming to those hotels if you look at manufacturing we are taking in security and surveillance Solutions because that's what's necessary to to have governance over all of those activities that happen if you take colleges obviously U again ubiquitous connect connectivity and and school and college Management Solutions and likewise with hospitals uh we are giving them Hospital Information Management Solutions as well as again for the patients who are admitted in those hospitals uh providing connectivity in room as well as also entertainment solutions for both the for the patients as well as their guests so putting together some of the proven Solutions but making it very relevant to these verticals is also seeing an increasing adoption not just of connectivity but also Digital Services broadly speaking talking about the the numbers uh now uh turning to revenue the Consolidated revenue for this year approaching now nearly 110,000 crores which is almost 12% year on-year growth when you look at this financial year as compared to the previous Financial year the Consolidated aita nearly 55,000 CR and that's also growing even faster at at nearly 12.8 or nearly 13% year on year uh looking at the quarter for the fourth quarter uh again the Consolidated revenues were at a higher run rate if you look at on an annualized basis revenues at 28871 crores and Aida at 14,360 crores um today the the the subscriber base stands at 41.8 million as on March 2024 and arus across such a large base is now at 181 or nearly 182 rupees per subscriber the monthly traffic on Gio also now crossed 14 exabytes on per month um total traffic for the for the quarter at uh 40 exabytes up 35% year on year and this is all being driven by like I mentioned the accelerating adoption of 5G as well as the growing penetration of home broadband both through geofiber and geoair fiber uh and again um like I mentioned Geo a fiber is translating into uh good demand not just in the big cities but also now going going towards tier 2 and Beyond looking at the uh data traffic just giving you a a growth ever since we came out of covid uh really if you see um while there was a very healthy upti through covid because that was the only Lifeline that people had but even coming out of it you can see that uh you can see a two and a half times increase that's 250% increase in annual traffic if you just look at the past 3 years uh and again like I said the the 5G roll out and the home connects is contributing uh tremendously to that and if you look at the per capita monthly data consumption uh it is now nearly approaching a gigabyte of consumption per day earlier we used to talk about gigabytes per month now I think soon we'll have to talk about gigabytes per day so at 28.7 GB very quickly approaching the 30 GB per month Mark and again all of this is largely being driven by the fact that Goos Network continues to be not just a leader in India but a global leader when it comes to all metrics uh including availability speed and uh latency all of this U works extremely well uh to to our growing uh story that we are unfolding for the country uh in terms of digital adoption with that I will hand it over to my colleague anuman who will talk about the operating and financial mats thank you K uh good evening everyone I'll quickly take you through the operating and the key financial metrices for both RG the Telecom business and JPL which is U you know the digital services company for RG Kiran spoke about the subscriber base at 41.8 million that's a healthy addition of 10.9 million for this quarter at a time when most of the other operators are either losing subscribers or or just about uh maintaining their current base we have been continuing to add subscribers uh uh through this period because of the the robust 5G Network the attraction of more users coming onto the 5G Network as well as initiatives we've taken at the lower end of the market with goobat the uh arpu was at 181.000 rupees um for this quarter U given this quarter had ler day plus I would like to point out here that at this point uh uh the 5G services are being offered on a promotional basis we're trying to create the ecosystem for 5G Services uh we are not charging customers separately for the 5G uh data offering that we giving them today uh which pretty much much means that 30% of the uh network data today or network usage is being given free of cost in that context uh we've been able to maintain our fairly healthy arpu and other Financial numbers the total data consumption uh went up to 40.9 G billion GBS for the quarter so that's you know if you look at the previous at the same time last year that's 35 per month total voice on the network has crossed 15 close to 1600 minutes per day so sustained Improvement across all of the customer engagement metrices which has always been a the financials for uh the connectivity business that is rjil um in Q4 uh it reported operating revenues of 2,959 which was a growth of 11% year on year uh and the Abida went up to 1,734 uh which is grow by 11 a half% year on year with some operating leverage so Aida margin at 53% once again to just remind you that we're not charging for 5G services at this point in time um and uh despite that we've been seeing fairly healthy growth in both revenues and Abida for the connectivity business moving on to the full year numbers for RG um the operating revenues for the full year for RG standard loan also went up to 1 lakh across 1 lakh K so at 1 lakh and what 119 cres for fiscal year 2324 uh that was a growth of a little over 10% year on year uh and the Abida came in at close to 53,000 car so uh growth of 12.4% year on year so almost a handed basis points increase in margins um through this period moving on to geop platforms limited um the operating revenue for the quarter for geop platforms Limited at a Consolidated level came in at 28871 CR and Abida at 14,360 and Pat at 5,583 cres now looking at the full year for JPL Revenue operating revenue of 1 lakh 9,558 CR and Abida of close to 55,000 crores at an Abida margin of little over 50% the profit off tax came in at 2,423 so um across the board fairly healthy growth rate uh including in the digital segment of the business for JPL U which we saw substantial growth through this year with this I'll hand over to DH to take you through the results for our retail business thanks anaman hi good evening everyone uh in terms of key performance highlights for uh for retail business uh it was a very important year for us we crossed the Milestone of uh three lakh crores in revenue and 23,000 crores in eida for the full Financial year our our overall revenues grow 18% on an year on-ear basis and 11% on a quarter on quarter basis on sorry on 18% for full year and 11% for the quarter on a YY basis uh in terms of segmental uh growth uh the growth for grocery for FY 24 was the highest at about 31% uh fashion lifestyle grew at about 23% and consumer electronics grew at about 18% our eida margins uh continue to expand uh for the full year the eida from operations was at 8.1% uh which is a 50 basis points year on-ear growth and for the quarter was 8.3% which is a 60 basis points year on-ear growth so we are consistently seeing the benefits of operating leverage as the infrastructure that we have put on the ground over the last two to three years uh it's heing fruits across uh channels also and across baskets the growth is is is strong so while the stores are growing our digital and newcommerce initiatives also continue to scale up nicely and they contributed about 18% of Revenue uh during the financial year 24 all our operating metrics have a strong upward Trend uh our registered customer base grew upwards of 300 million uh both pfalls and transactions were over a billion uh for the financial year uh we continue to expand our store footprint uh during the year we added 1840 new stores uh with gross area edition of 15.6 million uh just for reference this is more than uh the total retail area for uh for the next largest uh retailer in the country uh for the quarter we added added 562 stores with a gross area of 7.8 million square ft our total retail area now stands at close to 80 million qia KKR and Ria and as part of the same round uh Reliance Industries infused 25,000 crores taking the total Equity Capital raised to about 17,800 cror uh in terms of overall Revenue if you look at it 3 lakh 6,000 crores for the year uh total Eid of 23,000 CR and profit after tax of 11,000 cror for the full year so pretty healthy growth in in all the financial metrics moving on to some of the key highlights across the various business segments uh on electronics uh consistent Trend that we've been seen and and disclosing in the last few quarters is growth in average bill values as well as improving conversions so what we see is people are spending more on mobile phones uh ACS Etc uh or consumer durables so so that's showing a healthy growth in average bill values which is driving the growth for this business uh we saw pretty uh pretty strong sales in in AC's uh Summers came in uh in in March and that Trend continues uh we had the digital India Sales Event uh which saw 15% Yi growth in growth in sales across categories uh whether it's mobile phones whether it's a consumer durables uh the growth the growth is quite robust uh rescue which is our key differentiator uh continues to expand its service network uh we uh open 24 new centers during the quarter we have over a th000 centers overall across the length and breadth of the country uh and we served 1.2 million customers with the rescue offering uh We've also launched the out of warranty services and we are scaling that up pretty nicely uh our uh product business as well as our B2B B2B Toc business GMD uh continues to scale up well uh we continue to add new merchants in the jmd business uh we continue to expand the distribution footprint for our for our products getting our products available at new and new counters and keep adding uh new skus to expand our product offering uh during the quarter uh we also launched a new brand uh wasir uh where we introduced a range of poers and we'll be expanding it to other categories fashion and lifestyle uh we we had U a few festivals during the quarter as well as the winter where Drive which drove sales and customer engagement especially in the cooler parts of the country uh some of our new formats which we had launched last year specifically USTA aort and GAP uh they continue to do very well uh we are seeing very strong customer customer reception for these formats and we are scaling of these formats to uh set up more stores across the country uh our own brands in in the in the fashion lifestyle business bulk of what we sell is our own Brands and they continue to drive the growth three of Our Brands cross the Milestone of 2,000 CR annual sales which puts them amongst the largest largest fashion brands in the country uh we also continue to work on building a fast fashion supply chain ecosystem and increase the number of options uh that we launch uh because this helps us increase the freshness in stores as well as reduces the reduces the uh inventory uh inventory across the stores and some of the formats like USTA Etc where which are more younger Focus younger younger DG focused uh they require lot of new options getting launched every week so so that's something that we are working on and it's scaning up pretty nicely uh a GE b2c uh we continue to uh focus on improving the customer experience uh we look at launching new product features so we launch this quarter we launch the product rating feature which we started with with a pilot and then now it is available for all products across the platform uh we are also working on storefront personalization so if I open the open the goo app versus somebody is opening depending on preferences past Behavior past purchase Behavior what have we browsed in the past the recommendations that come and what will be visible will be very different so so that that does improve a lot of relevance and customer experience uh our focus is on you know exclusive Brands and new brands on the platform so we continue to strengthen the portfolio we grew the catalog 30% uh uh on a YY basis the allstar sale uh which is a March one uh event uh which which we do every year in fact all most of the fashion retailers were had some event at that point in time uh but we were able to demonstrate very strong traffic growth and a lot of customer additions uh during that period uh we did outperform most of our peers uh premium Brands Brands business continues to do very well in fact that's a trend that we are seeing across consumption baskets where uh there is a customer focus towards premiumization uh so premium uh Brands premium products are doing uh better than uh better than their peers in the Val Val side uh in the in in our premium in our partner Brands business we had a 20% growth during the year ax which is our which is the luxury part of our AIO platform uh that is doing while still small compared to the overall size of a Geo platform continues to do well uh we added 20 plus new brands we have over 600 Brands available on the platform and we continue to increase the option count so options were up 44% on a YY basis uh Hames we continue to grow its International presence uh we entered the Italy market and launched the first store in Italy jeels had a reasonably steady quarter uh in spite of a steep rise in gold prices uh which has impacted sales across the across the jewelry industry uh the business model Focus continues to focus on growing the diamond share which was up 100 basis points year on year and as all of you would be aware Diamond drives a profit gross marginal profitability to a large extent for the very jewelry business uh our focus in the business has been doing exclusive launches uh which are occasion specific and during uh in that theme during this quarter we launched the Makar sakranti Valentine's Day and and women's day collection uh which was receiv reasonably well received by the market uh grocery had another per quarter of very steady performance performance uh smart and smart bazars uh continue to drive the growth of of the business uh what we are seeing is uh average bill values are going up uh driven by premiumization which also drives better margin as well as the share of non- grossery is is increasing uh that is driving the margins for this business uh full PESA V sale which is a flagship which is a flagship event had had a pretty strong 21% growth on a Yi basis and you see is it's led by new categories HBC confectionary and and snacks uh another interesting Trend that we are seeing is that as we are going uh deeper and deeper uh we are building the deepest Regional network of of stores in the country there are Regional nuances which are coming to play which offer strong opportunities for growth so providing Regional assortment combined with national assortment uh provides a very strong value proposition for the customer just as this example in certain markets uh the sale during the runoff period to Ho exceeded the runoff period to Diwali now as you know diali is the biggest consumption period driven by Regional insights that we have around the assortment as well the communication that we do regionally and and that's where you know local influencers digital marketing you're able your ability to communicate digitally uh to the right customer segment uh in a localized manner helps a lot we are also focusing on growing new categories uh so example International Food body M serums these are some of the new categories which are growing very well as consumers preferences are changing uh we continue to refine our assortment our merchandising strategy uh so that we catch the new trends and are able to attract customers to our stores uh with uh with what they are looking for uh which are which are new options as well in addition to what they used to buying uh on our uh B2B Metro business we continue to see a good traction the Metro kirana Ober was a key event which we executed during the quarter uh to drive on boarding of new kiranas as well as in addition to Growing the kirana business we also focusing on growing the hka segment which provides a very large opportunity and that varies from you know small restaurants to large hotel chains uh there's a wide wide opportunity uh which is which is there in the hka segment as well which we are looking to tap on geomar uh uh again this is something that we we've talked about in the last few quarters our Focus has been on improving the average order values which were 30% on a year on-ear basis as well as increase the number of UN units per order which is up 37% on a YY basis uh while a lot of our selection is driven by 1p given the white width of categories that we are present in whether it's Electronics whether it's uh grocery whether it's fashion uh but uh in order to fill fill the increase the assortment and provide customers with a wide variety of choice we are also bringing 3p sellers onto the platform uh we our our seller base was up 94% on a YY basis and the selection available on 3p selection available on the platform was up 32% on a YY basis so uh we are able we are providing wider and wider choice to the consumers uh in addition to our entire assortment uh on on our our store assortment which is available on the geomar platform we continue to look at at key events like holy ready sale Republic Day Sale to drive customer engagement and grow grow the business uh these events act as good points to to acquire new customers as well as get them to try uh new categories get them to know build buy more from us we use a lot of basket Builder uh initiatives to drive U growth in uh customers engagement as well as new categories uh during these events uh we also continue to enhance the functionalities on the platform uh to improve the shopping experience for the customer so buy again is one wiget which we launched during the quarter uh we also have customer ratings for products or independent customer ratings uh which is available on the platform and we incentivize customers to provide uh genuine reviews consumer Brands business which is one of our newer newer businesses uh had last year was the first full year oper full year of operations uh the business uh continues to scale up nicely uh we had a 3X Yi growth in in General trade channel in addition to uh selling through the network of our own stores and our our B2B network uh we uh you would have seen a lot of new brands new products getting launched from our consumer Brands business uh two key brands that we launched last year was Campa in the beverages space and Independence in the staple space uh both of them had very strong traction uh and got very strong customer acceptance uh the products were liked by the customers and the price points were uh were quite attractive uh we are building the supply chain for these products so that we have a localized supply chain in different parts of the country and looking to scale up these businesses uh we launch several new products during the quarter uh we we uh launched an energy dink called Campa Runner uh we launched Necto which is an aired beverage uh we also launch gry which is a growing category and has substantial potential and there are other lot of other substantial uh other interesting products in the pipeline as well uh Acquisitions and Partnerships continues to be a core part of our strategy for our for our consumer Brands business uh during the quarter we completed the acquisition of uh IP rights and trade including trademarks and rep recipes for ralo as many of you may recollect at one point in time they had they had very well-known uh confectionary Brands and they still we did some research and they still these Brands still have a very strong brand recall amongst consumers uh so we we ac acquired these Brands uh as well as the recipes and this will be a key part of our confectionary strategy uh We've also partnered with elephant House of Sri Lanka where we will manufacture and sell their beverages under the elephant house brand in India it's a very popular brand in Sri Lanka and we also given them reciprocal rights to sell Campa in Sri Lanka so that we are able to Target markets Beyond India as well so that's a quick update on on on on the retail business thank you D very good evening to all on the call uh so we ended uh the year fi 24 on a high note uh as you can see we registered in a bit of 20,000 over 20,000 Crowes 20,200 cres uh which is uh one and a half times that of the previous year this is mainly on the back of higher production from the fields um the fields have now ramped up the Performing as per expectations and they're producing up to 30 million standard cubic meters at the current juncture with with about 23,000,000 barrels of condensate uh price realizations was slightly lower um uh during the course of the year but that has been more than offset by the higher production uh if we just recap uh what we've seen in the quarter gone by uh so having ramped up the fields uh overall in terms of production uh you know it's more or less flat uh even in the price realization it be more less flat uh the one good aspect of this quarter going by was that we had an incremental development plan uh approved by the government uh this has the potential to deliver increment production of 4 to 5 million 100 cubic met in a few years to come which would augment the production uh that we have uh also in terms of uh CDM uh we have successfully now contracted .9 Milli 7 cubic met of gas uh per day uh and uh we got a realization of about 12.67% plus 78 sets for for the next two years uh there were five successful biders so overall this was a good outcome given uh the contracts that we are currently seeing is slightly over 12% of brain so clearly a good result for us so overall when we look at the production we can see clearly there's been a uh sharp increase in production since fi21 and although overall domestic production uh besides kg D6 has been flat kg D6 has been the key trigger for incremental domestic production almost 90% of uh the incremental production has been from uh the fields in kgd so overall when we look at the outlook for the gas markets um clearly there were we've seen two consecutive Winters that have been mild uh consequently you've seen uh a buildup in the E storages Which is higher than uh previous years uh in fact almost 59% uh versus the 42% that we've seen in fiveyear averages that was that is uh in storages however ever we've seen that there has some there has been some price support particularly at lower prices uh we've seen uh Revival of demand from China India and Southeast Asia and uh we have also seen prices come back from earlier lows of $8 mbdu uh to currently around 10 and a half uh in the near term uh we feel uh there will be uh support for the demand and uh that mainly on the on the basis of strong brand prices uh which implies that alternate fuels will be more expensive and also support coming in from Asia demand support from Asia uh also there potential uncertainty of Russian supplies uh going forward uh with the expiries expected in September 24th um further we don't expect any substantial uh lerg capacity addition at least at least uh till the winter of 2024 so overall we expect gas prices to be more stable going forward supported by the higher demand and the current price Outlook so in the Indian gas market scenario we have clearly seen demand coming back in a big way uh particularly in the City Gas Distribution fertilizer and refiner sectors uh we've seen a 12% growth uh year on year clearly uh you know we see that this should continue to sustain mainly on the on the basis of uh prices being far more competitive as compared to alternate fuel prices which are driven by high Brent levels uh also uh you know uh policy framework being much more positive uh essentially uh there are two areas one is the uniform uh price tar uh which enables uh customers uh which are farther away from uh can get gas uh the transportation of gas will be uh far more economical um also uh the recent initiative by the government uh to ensure that gas based power is available as compared to low hydrogen generation during summer is a good sign um further with infrastructure pipeline infrastructure projects uh currently underway we expect the current 24,000 or kilometers that we have of pipeline in the country to be augmented by another 10,000 kilometers which would give more reach uh with respect to customers so overall there is a strong growth visibility for the Indian gas market uh so this boots well for overall outlook for EMP and particularly gas thank you thanks andj moving to the OTC side the full year f24 evida marginally higher than what it was last year at 62,400 cres you know I talked about the margin environment remaining remaining challenging and you have seen that in fuel cracks which fell anywhere between 20 and 45% of course they were from elevated levels uh some extent offset by lower AC um on the prochemical side uh you know the the decline was also sharp anywhere between 8 to 21% for polymers and when you look at the chain uh Delta it's about 6% individual products were significantly lower uh we were able to uh offset that uh you know by focusing on light feed cracking economics which has you know given that almost two3 of our um cracking happens on light feed which is an advantage for us um given where the prices of Ethan ethanes versus NAFTA also the focus on crude optimizing crude procurement um also uh we were helped by the fact that the demand environment for was good as far as domestic is concerned so a lot of placement done domestically uh so the even this context you know this is it's a it's a good outcome to have uh you know maintain if not like the grow the evid for our o2c business just for the quarter uh you can see that 16, 777 up 3% uh year on year and uh up 19% on a quarter and quarter um overall as I mentioned uh you know the environment margin environment has been weak however as I mentioned the set of actions be it on crude processing or light cracking advantage that we have and the fact that there was also a slightly marginal increase in volumes on the quarter and quarter side that was much sharp sharply higher that 19% growth um because uh you know all the units were available post the planned maintenance and inspection activity the last water also we did see some Rebound in gasoline cracks um also p and PP Deltas were also six to 7 higher than six to six and 7% respectively uh just the context about overall you know the key takeaways here are that Global for the fourth quarter oil demand up 1.6 million barrels per day you look at it geograph geography wise led by China at about point 8 million barrels per day and then the other Asian countries product wise if you see led by really jet up7 million barrels per day and gas oil 26 um overall from a quarter point of view polymer demand and uh was stable polyester marginally weaker however I will show you in the subsequent slides that the when you look at it from a year- on-ear point of view uh the the demand has been pretty robust uh operating rates uh lower uh refiner operat operating rates down by almost 260 basis points because of unplanned refiner outages and maintenance on the cracker side lowered by 340 basis points because of uh new capacity additions mainly in Middle East Asia and also the demand uh Global demand trend has has not been good um this is the oil demand uh in as far as India is concerned and they're just focusing on the lower part of the Box uh which which is the year on year you can see that uh overall demand for oil at 4.6% strong growth um and if you look at the components you can see that ATF has been close to 12% growth diesel about 4 and a half% growth gasoline about 6 and a half% growth so strong numbers that you are seeing almost mirrored when you look at it from a quarter on quarter point a few and U you know gasoline obviously led by the trends in Mobility diesel on the back of demand for agre as well as mining activities industrial activities growth and ATF on the back of Passenger traffic and you can see that passenger traffic at 39 million passengers is up about 4 and a half% year on year on the polymer side again looking at the lower part of the Box uh this is what I was referring to year on-ear growth in polymer up 14% of which P has been demand for PE coming on the back of uh you know infrastructure pipes and also the packaging sector be fmcg and Retail PP is up on the back of demand for Consumer durables automative uh and household appliances uh PVC up driven by Agriculture and infrastructure and a lot of government projects and that's something that you could have seen uh in the quarter on quarter basis the aberation in PVC is really more to do with the fact that at the same time in fourth quarter of fi23 there was significantly higher Imports because uh as EDC prices collapsed in the US and there was a lot of imports but other than that uh you can see that P and PP grew by six and 7% respectively polyester side again lower part of the Box 4% growth really led by P and uh you know the beverage segment has been doing well uh you know increase in tourism Cricket World Cup you have seen that kind of growth and same thing mirrored in the fourth quarter also you can see that P demand up on back of you know summer that is coming and you know Yan and fiber has been on the back of weak textile export demand overall when you see the um quarter on quarter Trends a bit mixed in as far as fourth quarter is concerned PPP went up PVC lower by 7% um of course the Ethan prices falling 16% and quarter on quarter uh did help improve the ethane versus NAFTA cracking economics um on a year on-year basis you can see that it you know Deltas fell anywhere between 8 and 21% and this is coming on the back of um commissioning of new capacities uh you know demand I talked about and so in a way market was very well supplied um overall the product prices also decreased uh significantly more and well been 10 to 19% while NAFTA prices decreased by only 11% so that's the weakness you saw there polyester chain that your on year basis has been lower by 6% um you know there was there was an led by tight supplies and um of course if you're an integrated producer you continue to optimize production based on PX versus gasoline economics that's what we did and P margins there was affected by the capacity expansion in China on quarter on quarter basis broadly stable uh you know M Deltas did improve uh because of higher trates um and PX Deltas were lower because of firm feet stock prices there moving to the transportation um you know cracks on gas oil you know demand as I mentioned up 26 million barrels per day and uh on a both on a quarter on quarter and year on year you can see that the uh cracks have moderated from the high but yet at 23 uh uh uh dollars it is it does remain in the healthy category um you know the of course the it's you know the fall is really more to do with uh uh seasonal weakness uh in demand uh new supplies from Supply from new refineries as well as those coming from maintenance yes dra down from the inventory jeto demand you know up by7 Billion barrels per day more led by Asia Pacific um quarter on quarter cracks moderated with Chinese exports it's also seasonal Demand Being lower and year on year cracks came off from 26 to 21.2 um and clearly you can see the um increase of the inventory levels building from 101 to 117 on a year on-ear basis and gasoline cracks overall you have seen about2 million barrels per day across North America and Europe quarter on quarter you saw a sharp jump in cracks from 7.6 to 13.3 um on the back of unplanned Refinery outages maintenance in us and Asia uh we also saw lower inventories and also lower exports from China and then the part about you know the anticipation of the US driving season which drove quarter on quarter cracks overall this is the uh fuel cracks when you see F year picture um all of them year on year you can see 23 versus 20 fi23 versus f24 all of them uh coming off historic I because fi23 was the year of significant dislocation in the energy markets as I was mentioning gas oil impacted by the resilience in Russian supplies and also higher supplies from new refineries gasoline declined again coming from new refineries and also uh um there has been you know Rising demand in China which supported to some extent the cracks otherwise it would have been significantly lower and the ATF um yeah the takeaway from this slide is the fact that you know production meant for sale uh you know went up from 16.4 to 17.2 um as we came out of the major M&I activity in the last quarter um the other the other points about you know clearly you can see Focus has been on crude and Ethan sourcing um you know focus on domestic fuel sales um optimization of gasoline versus PX um focus on gasoline in the US uh in the US markets and uh you know really sustaining our gasifier operations so that we have very minimal dependence on LG sourcing so the broader Dynamics here when you look at it uh you know the point being that oil demand still in 24 is expected to be 1.2 million barrels per day and it is coming after you know the growth of 2.3 that we saw in 23 the domestic demand uh continues to be strong for fuel and downstream chemicals given the emphasis on infra Mobility being there and you know the whole consumer sentiment so leading to boy there gasoline cracks um uh you know think is expected to be supported by strong seasonal demand the fact that there is lower inventory middle plates will uh will be likely remaining firm uh given given the disruptions and Refinery vulnerability in Conflict zones and downstream chemical margins you know is we do expect it to recover gradually with slowing pace of capacity addition overall when you think of it challenges from a volatility standpoint really is the the whole uh you know OPEC Plus members extending voluntary production cuts um geopolitical tensions in Middle East and you know the whole Russian Ukraine uh aspect and and its impact on oil prices um you know any any attack on energy infrastructure you know like we saw uh you know does does result in loss of defining capacity so these kind of things are you know challenging which also impart a lot of volatility geopolitics you know you are seeing it in higher Voyage time you're seeing it in Bunker consumption increases as well as the increase in flight rates and um the newer Refinery starting up in China Middle East and West Africa uh you know will will POS a challenge in the sense that uh you can have incremental product Supply out praising demand in Major Market so the point here is you know there is the whole play of geopolitics there is this in incremental supplies production cut this can influence energy and commodity prices but overall you can see that Transportation fuel given the more broader construct uh you know it does look uh healthy from a broader demand point of view and and downstream chemical uh demand uh you know will uh post all the increases that we have seen in capacity in China elsewhere um you know that pace is uh really slowing down and uh you know we do hope that for more gradual recovery and as far as pken Deltas are concerned yeah just to summarize um you've seen the operating performance uh very strong very robust on the back of uh you know strong execution we have doubled our Avida in 5year Period consumer Abida particularly is up 4X in the same period and uh when you think about each of the businesses in our minds there is strong visibility of uh of continuing growth trajectory uh as well as the you know overall when you put the numbers together our earnings um do show very very subdued volatility when you look at the whole portfolio uh take the portfolio as a whole um on the energy business for us uh you know the next phase uh you know will be led more by India Centric capacity expansion the vinil chains we have talked about um you know customer centricity uh the whole Focus there and circular circularity are focus on um on green energy investment uh you know involves integrated managing ecosystem and the ability to deliver round the Around the Clock power um you know both at a lower cost as well as cost and and with low least amount of volatility and as far as energy costs are concerned uh kgd 6 coming in at the right time providing valuable transition fuel for the economy on the retail and Geo side uh you know we have a clearly cut strategy um as some aspects that Kiran talked about um strategies in terms of uh for individuals for homes for Enterprises and digital platform uh retail the whole focus is on uh expanding the Omni Channel offering the focus on Logistics uh product development and premiumization and as Anan you know you know highlighted you know today's capacity uh almost 30% of the 5G the network is on 5G traffic is almost 30% and that and if you think about it from a broader monetization points of point you can see a larger runway for growth there overall where we have come is to have a very robust balance sheet uh um you saw the capex intensity being lower you are seeing that the capex spend is lower than you know the cash profits that we are making and uh the heavy the the capex in as far as Geo is concerned you know a lot of that is uh you know that that got completed in in the last in this in the last Financial year so overall direction looks good balance sheet looks strong businesses are delivering strong results and Outlook also remains pretty pretty robust um thank you so much [Music]"
