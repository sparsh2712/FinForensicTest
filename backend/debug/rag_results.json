What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?\nOil to Chemicals:\nAll sites operate with valid Environmental Clearance approvals obtained after following the due process of Environmental Impact Assessment and evaluation by the Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests or by the delegated State Authority. The sites have valid Consents from the State Pollution Control Boards to operate.\nThe sites comply with all conditions prescribed as part of these approvals and those by various Central and State government authorities. The impact of the operations are thus well within those predicted and prescribed.\n\n## Shipping:\n\nWith most of the crude being supplied to RIL by sea vessel, and the overwhelming majority of refined products being exported by sea, road and pipeline the Company faces the risk of HSE incidents, oil spills and so on, which may lead to significant adverse impact to the environment.\nRIL has a strong vessel vetting, incident monitoring and emergency response system. The Company's augmented ship vetting programme ensures that the vessels that are contracted to carry RIL Cargo are screened based on risks prior to their induction. The 3rd party ship vetting system based on extensive data analysis narrowed the risks arising in cases where physical inspection of vessels could not be carried out due to COVID-19. Vendor management audits are\ncarried out at prescribed intervals for time charters and STS service providers in accordance with the Marine Assurance Framework.\nRILs control framework for road transportation has matured over a period of time and is run in collaboration with contractors. The Company supports the contractors through capacity building for their drivers in areas such as defensive driving, route hazard mapping and real-time tracking. A dedicated state-of-the-art emergency response centre provides emergency response to transporters.\n\n## Exploration \\& Production:\n\nNo adverse impacts were envisaged.\n![img-68.jpeg](img-68.jpeg)\n![img-69.jpeg](img-69.jpeg)\n9.

The Company has in-house desalination plants based on Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) technologies. After desalination, brine water was pumped back into ocean.\nPetrochemical (including polyester) operations: Water used in the petrochemical operation was primarily sourced from surface water resources.\n\n## Lifecycle Impact Analysis\n\nThe results have been calculated across 5 impact categories for the 18 products listed below. The results can be shared on a case-to-case basis upon request.\n\n| Refinery Products | Petrochemical (including polyester) <br> Products |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Allylate | Aromatics |\n| Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) | Filament |\n| Diesel | Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) |\n| Fuel Oil | Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) |\n| Gasoline | Polyethylene (PE) |\n| Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) | Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) |\n| Naphtha | Polypropylene (PP) |\n| Sulphur | Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) |\n| TAME | Staples |\n\nThese 18 products contribute to over $90 \\%$ of the total turnover.\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the study, no significant issues were identified pertaining to all impact categories. However, the following inference were derived from the LCA assessment:\n\n## Climate Change\n\nRefinery and petrochemical operations demonstrate high energy efficiency. In addition, internal benchmarking was carried out for refinery and petrochemical products, comparing them to the available benchmarks. Within the Cradle to Gate boundary, the upstream sources of GHG emissions are crude oil, fuel and other feedstock exploration and transportation.\n\nSources of GHG emissions in operations are primarily from combustion of fuels for process heat and from hydrogen generation. The use of green hydrogen can help in reducing the carbon footprint of the products. The Company's ongoing efforts in green hydrogen are aligned to fulfill this aspect.\nPower and steam consumption in refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations also contribute to GHG emissions. Currently, the primary fuel utilised for power and steam generation in refinery operations is syngas produced from the pet coke gasification process. In petrochemical (including polyester) operations, grid electricity and coal are the predominant energy sources. However, with the company's ongoing efforts to transition to renewable energy, and adapting biofuels and low-carbon fuels, it is possible to reduce the carbon footprint associated with refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) products.\nThough the Company does not have direct control over upstream GHG emissions associated with crude oil and other raw materials exploration and transportation, it is working towards yield improvement and optimisation. Furthermore, the Company is evaluating available alternatives to explore sourcing crude oil with a lower environmental footprint.\n\n## Water Use\n\nIn refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations, water is used primarily for cooling processes and steam generation. The Company has implemented initiatives for steam condensate recovery to reduce water requirements for steam generation. It is using desalinated water in its refinery operations to reduce its reliance on freshwater withdrawal.\n\n## Acidification\n\nMajor gate-to-gate contributors to acidification are fuel combustion and combustion of other refinery and petrochemical off-gases. The Company is aiming to move towards substituting more renewable energy in place of fossil fuels which will reduce the quantity of Sulphur entering the ecosystem, hence, further lowering the acidification potential.\n\n## Eutrophication (Marine and Freshwater)\n\nThe operations conducted within the refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) divisions do not directly contribute to eutrophication in marine and freshwater environments. However, the impacts related to eutrophication are associated with the upstream emissions generated during the production of raw materials.",

The Company has in-house desalination plants based on Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) technologies. After desalination, brine water was pumped back into ocean.\nPetrochemical (including polyester) operations: Water used in the petrochemical operation was primarily sourced from surface water resources.\n\n## Lifecycle Impact Analysis\n\nThe results have been calculated across 5 impact categories for the 18 products listed below. The results can be shared on a case-to-case basis upon request.\n\n| Refinery Products | Petrochemical (including polyester) <br> Products |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Allylate | Aromatics |\n| Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) | Filament |\n| Diesel | Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) |\n| Fuel Oil | Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) |\n| Gasoline | Polyethylene (PE) |\n| Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) | Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) |\n| Naphtha | Polypropylene (PP) |\n| Sulphur | Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) |\n| TAME | Staples |\n\nThese 18 products contribute to over $90 \\%$ of the total turnover.\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the study, no significant issues were identified pertaining to all impact categories. However, the following inference were derived from the LCA assessment:\n\n## Climate Change\n\nRefinery and petrochemical operations demonstrate high energy efficiency. In addition, internal benchmarking was carried out for refinery and petrochemical products, comparing them to the available benchmarks. Within the Cradle to Gate boundary, the upstream sources of GHG emissions are crude oil, fuel and other feedstock exploration and transportation.\n\nSources of GHG emissions in operations are primarily from combustion of fuels for process heat and from hydrogen generation. The use of green hydrogen can help in reducing the carbon footprint of the products. The Company's ongoing efforts in green hydrogen are aligned to fulfill this aspect.\nPower and steam consumption in refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations also contribute to GHG emissions. Currently, the primary fuel utilised for power and steam generation in refinery operations is syngas produced from the pet coke gasification process. In petrochemical (including polyester) operations, grid electricity and coal are the predominant energy sources. However, with the company's ongoing efforts to transition to renewable energy, and adapting biofuels and low-carbon fuels, it is possible to reduce the carbon footprint associated with refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) products.\nThough the Company does not have direct control over upstream GHG emissions associated with crude oil and other raw materials exploration and transportation, it is working towards yield improvement and optimisation. Furthermore, the Company is evaluating available alternatives to explore sourcing crude oil with a lower environmental footprint.\n\n## Water Use\n\nIn refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations, water is used primarily for cooling processes and steam generation. The Company has implemented initiatives for steam condensate recovery to reduce water requirements for steam generation. It is using desalinated water in its refinery operations to reduce its reliance on freshwater withdrawal.\n\n## Acidification\n\nMajor gate-to-gate contributors to acidification are fuel combustion and combustion of other refinery and petrochemical off-gases. The Company is aiming to move towards substituting more renewable energy in place of fossil fuels which will reduce the quantity of Sulphur entering the ecosystem, hence, further lowering the acidification potential.\n\n## Eutrophication (Marine and Freshwater)\n\nThe operations conducted within the refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) divisions do not directly contribute to eutrophication in marine and freshwater environments. However, the impacts related to eutrophication are associated with the upstream emissions generated during the production of raw materials.",

RIL is working with EcoVadis for supply chain sustainability rating by evaluating vendors for sustainable performance.\n4. RIL is also exploring with vendors the use of Biomass Briquettes in our system to further reduce our carbon footprint.\n5. Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups\nThe teams of Reliance Foundation engage regularly with communities and key identified beneficiaries to understand their existing needs, resolve any concerns and support their progress and development. During FY 2022-23, Reliance Foundation organised multi-stakeholder interactions with various groups such as Farmer Producer Organisations, Stakeholders in Disaster Management and others, through focused deliberation to address concerns. The total reach during the year was over 76.5 lakhs people. In crisis and emergency situations such as disasters, the most vulnerable are sought out to provide support and ensure their safety. The team Reliance Foundation also supports professional training, development and skill building of healthcare providers, coaches, athletes and teaching fraternity to enhance impact on spheres of education, public health and sports for development.\nAt Reliance, stakeholder inclusiveness has been a fundamental part of its responsible CSR practices and is essential in understanding opinions and perceptions of its stakeholders particularly the vulnerable/ marginalised communities and targeted beneficiaries Before initiating a CSR project, an assessment is done to establish rationale for selecting activities based on desired needs of the community, taking into consideration other external factors.\n![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)\n![img-43.jpeg](img-43.jpeg)\n\nThese assessments provide the reference point for designing an intervention that best reflects community aspirations and concerns instead of acting in a top-down manner.\nTools, such as Participatory Rural Appraisals and Rapid Rural Appraisals, are used to develop a joint plan of action for the development of the community with elements of sustainability right from the beginning. This is done by gathering information and opinions from stakeholders i.e. informal leaders, communities, authorities, NGOs and Government Departments through one-on-one meetings, Focused Group Discussions etc. for understanding the local ecosystem and deploying locally relevant solutions to reach out at scale and achieve maximum impact Feedback provided by the communities also forms a critical component in redefining strategies for improvements of the CSR programme. In case of youth skill building and identifying sporting talent, there is a strong grassroots approach to identify talented individuals and provide them with an ecosystem support. In the case of public health, outreach to hard-to-reach areas and developing a cadre of health outreach professionals with infrastructure such as MMUs helps address key health concerns and provide support. To address concerns of these communities, various interventions/actions taken in different focus areas are\n\n1. Helping vulnerable communities cope with disasters through comprehensive, multi-pronged prevention and mitigation strategy.\n2. Ensuring the well-being of rural communities by strengthening the local governance system, empowering communities with knowledge, expertise and livelihood solutions, besides enhancing the rural ecosystem by creation of livelihood assets.\n3. Capability building of the rural communities for diversifying and additional sources of livelihood and employment.\n4. Empowering women by building their leadership and entrepreneurial skills along with providing them with increased access to economic opportunities.\n5. Creating access to quality healthcare for all by developing a multi-tiered health response system ranging from mobile medical units (MMU) and static medical units (SMU) in rural and urban areas, offering primary and preventive healthcare services, to hospitals at the tertiary level.\n6. Conserving the environment by undertaking holistic natural resource management including water and soil conservation and enhancement, increasing the green cover, facilitating climate-smart practices and optimum utilisation of activities.\n7. Promoting quality and holistic primary, secondary and tertiary education through RF Schools and 3o Institute besides providing support to schools run by state governments and municipal bodies with state of art digital tools for improving learning experience of students.\n8. Leveraging sports as a medium to encourage learning and to build leadership among the children and youth of India, offering a platform to budding athletes across India to develop their talents and prowess in multiple sports to place India on the global stage and strengthen the country's sporting ecosystem.\n![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)",

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity\n\nRIL follows a stakeholder centric approach and has established a robust procedure to effectively engage with various internal and external stakeholder groups. As a prerequisite, we identify and prioritise our stakeholders, based on the impacts of the Company on stakeholders and the ability of stakeholder groups to influence the functioning of the Company.\n\nDuring stakeholder identification stage, we consider the Company's positive and negative impacts and which stakeholder groups are either affected by or interested in the same. In the next stage, we prioritise the stakeholder groups that can significantly influence the Company's decision-making process and its operations. As a result, we have identified 6 external and 3 internal stakeholder groups\nsignificant for our operations. Our key external stakeholders include shareholders' investors, government regulators, customers, local communities, suppliers, and NGOs (Non-Government Organisation), while our key internal stakeholders are comprised of our employees, contractual employees and senior management.\nWhile conducting our materiality assessment exercise in FY 2021-22, we extensively interacted with our key stakeholder groups and sought their valuable insights in identifying key material issues. Additionally, we regularly engage with our stakeholders through various channels to seek their input, understand their needs $\\&$ desires, and address their concerns.
