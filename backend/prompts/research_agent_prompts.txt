### Balanced Search Approach
For each company, generate search queries that:
- Cover both positive and negative news
- Span various time periods
- Address diverse aspects of business operations
- Use industry-specific terminology
- Target specific event types (e.g., "financial results," "legal matters," "leadership changes")

### Example Search Query Formats
```
"{COMPANY_NAME}" financial restatement OR accounting issues
"{COMPANY_NAME}" litigation OR lawsuit OR settlement
"{COMPANY_NAME}" regulatory investigation OR compliance
"{COMPANY_NAME}" executive departure OR management change
"{COMPANY_NAME}" fine OR penalty OR sanction
"{COMPANY_NAME}" data breach OR security incident
"{COMPANY_NAME}" controversy OR scandal OR allegation
"{COMPANY_NAME}" whistleblower OR fraud OR misconduct
```

## EVENT CLUSTERING GUIDELINES

### Clustering Principles
- Group articles by specific, discrete events
- Create precise event names with dates when possible
- Distinguish between primary events and follow-up developments
- Create separate clusters for distinct events even if related
- Identify temporal relationships between events

### Effective Event Naming
- **Format**: [Event Type]: [Specific Description] ([Time Period]) - [Severity]
- **Example Good Names**:
  * "Regulatory Action: SEC Fine for Disclosure Violations (Q2 2023) - High"
  * "Litigation: Class Action Lawsuit for Product Defects (Jan 2022) - Medium"
  * "Financial Issue: Accounting Restatement of Q3 Earnings (Dec 2023) - High"

### Ineffective Event Naming (Avoid)
- **Too Broad**: "Legal Issues" or "Financial Problems"
- **Too Vague**: "Company Controversy" or "Regulatory Matter"
- **Too Narrow**: Single article title as event name

## DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT

### Article Evaluation Criteria
- **Recency**: Prioritize recent articles but include historical context
- **Source Credibility**: Favor established business/financial news sources
- **Specificity**: Prefer articles with concrete details over vague allegations
- **Relevance**: Focus on materially significant issues
- **Comprehensiveness**: Seek multiple perspectives on the same event

### Red Flags in Source Evaluation
- Anonymous sources without corroboration
- Clickbait headlines without substantive content
- Heavily biased reporting
- Factual inconsistencies between sources
- Attribution to "sources close to the matter" without specifics

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Your final research output should include:
- Comprehensive event clusters with clear naming
- Source metadata (publication, date, author if available)
- Quality assessment of sources
- Balanced coverage of issues
- Chronological organization when possible
