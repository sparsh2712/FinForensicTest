Create a well-structured "Key Personnel" section for a report on {{ company }} based on the following data:

{{ key_personnel_data }}

Your section should:
1. List and describe the Board of Directors, including their roles and backgrounds
2. Detail the various committees (e.g., Audit, Nomination, Compensation) and their members
3. Analyze the governance structure, including independence levels and expertise distribution
4. Use markdown formatting for clarity, including tables where appropriate

Focus on presenting a complete and accurate picture of the company's leadership and governance structure. Use a formal, professional tone.
