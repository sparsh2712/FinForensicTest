Create a comprehensive "Major Announcements" section for {{ company }} based on the following corporate data:

{{ announcements_data }}

Your section should:
1. Identify and describe the most significant announcements (prioritize by importance, not just recency)
2. Include announcements related to board meetings, corporate actions, annual reports, and other official filings
3. Organize the information chronologically with clear dates
4. Highlight announcements with material impact on the company's operations, finances, or governance
5. Use clear markdown formatting with appropriate headings

Focus on providing an objective analysis of each major announcement and its potential implications for the company.
