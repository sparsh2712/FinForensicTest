Create an insightful "Major Governance Concerns" section for {{ company }} based on the following data from multiple sources:

{{ governance_data }}

Your section should:
1. Identify any significant governance concerns or red flags
2. Analyze board composition, independence, and expertise
3. Evaluate committee structures and effectiveness
4. Assess disclosure practices and transparency
5. Note any regulatory compliance issues or legal challenges
6. Compare governance practices to industry standards or best practices

If there are no major concerns identified, provide a balanced assessment of the company's governance strengths and potential areas for improvement.

Format your section using clear markdown with appropriate headings and structure.
