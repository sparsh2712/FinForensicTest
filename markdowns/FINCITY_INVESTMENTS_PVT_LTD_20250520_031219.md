## 1. BACKGROUND

The Satyam scandal, one of India's largest corporate frauds, involved the manipulation of accounts and financial records at Satyam Computer Services. Ramalinga Raju, the chairman of Satyam, confessed in January 2009 to inflating the company's revenue and profits over several years. This confession triggered a massive investigation into Satyam's operations and the role of its promoter group entities. Fincity Investments Pvt. Ltd., along with other entities like Highgrace Investments Pvt. Ltd. and Veeyes Investments Pvt. Ltd., were identified as part of this promoter group. These entities were implicated in the scandal due to their shareholding in Satyam and subsequent sale of those shares in the market, potentially benefiting from the inflated stock prices. The scandal had a devastating impact on Satyam's market value and reputation, ultimately leading to its acquisition by Tech Mahindra.

The involvement of promoter group entities like Fincity Investments raises questions about the extent of knowledge and participation in the fraudulent activities. It suggests a coordinated effort to benefit from the inflated value of Satyam shares, potentially at the expense of minority shareholders and the overall integrity of the market.
