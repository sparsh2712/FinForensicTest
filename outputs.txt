Besides Kumari, three Bangladeshi nationals were arrested last month.\n\nFake documents in the name of the Bangladesh High Commission in New [Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/section/cities/delhi/), were allegedly prepared to claim there was a relationship between the donor and recipient (both Bangladeshi) — a requisite as per Indian law. Sources said that these forged documents have also been seized.\n\nKumari, a senior consultant and a kidney transplant surgeon, sources said, joined Apollo Hospital as a junior doctor almost 15 years ago. She was engaged on a fee-for-service basis and not on the hospital’s payroll.\n\n“Given this action by the police, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals (IAH) placed the doctor under suspension.

The spokesperson added: “This action is subsequent to an investigation pertaining to procedures carried out at another hospital and prima facie not related to any action or acts at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.”\n\nIn the present case, one Rasel, 29, along with associates Mohammed Sumon Miyan, Ifti, all based in Bangladesh, and Tripura-based Ratish Pal, lured potential donors from their country to Delhi. They would donate their kidneys for Rs 4-5 lakh and recipients were charged to the tune of Rs 25-30 lakh, a source said. Except for Ifti, all other accused have been arrested.\n\n“We received information after a kidney racket was busted in Rajasthan and police started working around three months ago. All the accused are first-timers, and they are giving Rs 2-3 lakh to the doctor for every transplant,” the source said.\n\nIn the present case, donors and recipients coordinated their stay, treatment, and tests through a medical tourism company named Al Shifa, sources said. The statement of a victim has been recorded under Section 164 CrPC which is admissible evidence in court.\n\nSources said the victim’s medical records from Yatharth Hospital have been seized, showing forged documents from the Bangladesh High Commission. “These documents show it was misused to complete the medical file linked to the transplantation record of the victim,” the source said.\n\nSources said the police are now investigating an organized crime syndicate. During the probe, Vikram, working as an assistant to Kumari, has also been arrested in the case.\n\nRecords show Rasel had rented a flat in Jasola Village. “Five to six donors were staying at this rented flat. All the tests before the transplant were completed. The recipients would also meet the donors at the flat,” the source said.\n\nDuring the arrests, sources said, a bag recovered from Rasel’s room contained nine passports, two diaries, and a register. These passports belonged to kidney donors and recipients and the diary reportedly had details of monetary transactions between the donor and recipient.\n\nThe police are also said to have seized another bag from Mohd Rokon, which contained 20 stamps of different impressions and two stamp ink pads (blue and red), allegedly used to create the fake papers.

The racket involves “elaborate forging of identity documents and staging of ‘family’ photographs to present donors as the relatives of would-be patients,” it added.\n\nAs part of the investigation, one of the _Telegraph_’s reporter posed as a relative of a sick aunt, who urgently needed a kidney transplant but had no family members able to donate. The reporter reached out to Apollo’s Myanmar offices, and was told that a “stranger would be sourced to donate their kidney.”\n\nThe reporter was also told that a patient can choose their donor and then arrange a payment to the individual.\n\nThe head of Apollo’s Myanmar operation gave an “Apollo-branded costs document” to the undercover reporter.\n\nThe document also said a patient can expect to incur, in total, up to (Rs 1,79,500). This, however, didn’t include the money given to a donor, which could be around 70 or 80 lakh in most cases.\n\nOnce an upfront cash payment is made, the donor is flown to India. The individual, along with the patient, then appears in front of the transplant authorisation committee for an interview.\n\nHowever, one of the Apollo’s Myanmar agents told the reporter that the committee, which also includes several Apollo Hospital officials, is “just a facade” and asks only superficial questions about the relationship between the patient and donor.\n\nThe agents also forge family trees, household documents, marriage certificates and photographs to establish familial relationships between patients and paid donors.\n\n_The Telegraph_’s report has mentioned the name of Dr Sandeep Guleria, who trained in the UK and is a recipient of the Padma Shri. Patients and agents told the newspaper that Guleria was the surgeon who conducted the transplants.\n\nThe report also quoted _Deccan Herald_ newspaper’s 2016 report, mentioning that Guleria “was expected to be summoned for questioning in connection to a separate kidney scandal linked to Apollo’s Delhi hospital.”\n\nIn 2016, two of Apollo’s secretarial staff at the Indraprastha Hospital were arrested alongside a gang of brokers and donors for allegedly being involved in a kidney racket.

The tumour was very much in the brain. Ultimately she has to undergo Gamma Knife Radio Surgery in the VIMHANS Hospital. Under these circumstances, we are of the view that interest of justice will suffice if compensation of Rs 10 lakh is awarded to the complainant…plus litigation  \nexpense of Rs 50,000,” it said.\n\nThe forum further said 80 per cent of the amount shall be paid by the hospital and the rest borne by the concerned doctor.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Devi was admitted to the hospital in September 2002 as she was suffering constant headache for around nine months.\n\nShe was suggested to undergo an operation due to the tumour. However, instead of removing it, the area of the tumour was suppressed in the operation, it said.\n\nAfter some time, the tumour erupted again causing her more headache. The hospital claimed there was no tumour in her brain and suggested some medicines, the complaint claimed.\n\nIt said Devi took the medicines for two years but as there was no relief, she had to be admitted to the other hospital in 2004 which confirmed the presence of the tumour and was operated upon there.\n\nThereafter, Devi’s family members approached the state consumer commission seeking Rs 42 lakh as compensation. The state commission referred the complaint to the district forum.\n\nThe hospital and the doctor concerned have denied any deficiency on their part.\n```', 'article_title': 'Delhi: Apollo Hospital to pay Rs 10 lakh for wrong treatment', 'event_category': 'Wrong Treatment: Apollo Hospital to Pay Compensation (June 2016) - Medium', 'url': 'https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/delhi-apollo-hospital-to-pay-rs-10-lakh-for-wrong-treatment-2871808/', 'metadata': {'source_domain': 'indianexpress.com', 'fetch_timestamp': '2025-02-26T23:20:07.144924', 'fetch_method': 'requests_with_extraction', 'content_size': 30669, 'extraction_success': True}}], 'Apollo Hospital Held Liable: Non-Disclosure of Treatment Cost (December 2023) - Medium': [{'ALLEGATIONS': "Apollo Hospitals, Chennai, is accused of unfair trade practices and deficiency in service for not disclosing the full cost of treatment to a patient's family.
