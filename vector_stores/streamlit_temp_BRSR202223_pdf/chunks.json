If yes, what percentage of inputs were sourced sustainably?\n\nFor our Oil to Chemicals business, we have adopted a proprietary 'Sustainable Procurement' solution offered by an independent third-party, 'Ecolxads'. As on March 31, 2023, we have engaged with over $90 \\%$ of our suppliers.\nThis is not applicable for Exploration \\& Production business as sourcing is to be carried out as per procedure stipulated under Production Sharing Contract signed with Govt. of India.\n3. Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste\na. Plastics (including packaging)\n\nAt RIL, we are committed to adopt reuse/recycle principles and End of Life solutions such as waste to road.\na) PET recycling: We have PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) bottle recycling capacity of around 30000 TPM in Hoshiarpur, Barabanki and Nagothane. We are also partnering with SirChakra, a leading recycler, to put up PET\n![img-28.jpeg](img-28.jpeg)\nbottle recycling plant in Andhra Pradesh. This will double our bottle recycling capacity to five billion bottles per year.\nb) Waste to Roast: We have introduced ReRoute ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ which uses difficult to recycle, end of life, flexible plastic packaging waste, including multi-layer plastic films. It adds value to the littered waste plastic and enhances the quality of road and its durability. We have got this product tested from Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) and as per their report, $8 \\%$ of bitumen can be substituted with ReRoute ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$.\nc) Waste to Oil: We are working on our own RIL technology for chemical recycling (Pyrolysis Oil). Commissioning of 10 TPD demo plant has been completed along with successful completion of product trials.\nd) Polyolefin (PO) recycling: Efforts are underway to establish Polyolefin recycling capacity through asset light model and buy and sell arrangements. Initial trials with various vendors are under progress.\n\n## b. E-waste\n\nDisposal of e-waste is governed by E-waste rules, 2016. Our Enterprise Procurement team has specific procedures to deal with the same. Starting from request by plant/ business function, there are two options that they can choose to go with for auction of e-waste. One is MSTC Limited (formerly Metal Scrap Trade Corporation Limited) website which is a Government of India Platform and another one is our own RFX Manager auction platform. In case of MSTC, the qualification of bidders and compliance are already taken care as part of vendor qualification and their license validity. Within our own platform, we have separate screening/ validation\nto check the license validity of the bidders, apart from internal controls and approvals. The winning bidder disposes the waste and provides a certificate to RIL confirming disposal ensuring all regulatory and environmental guidelines. For disposal of data related e-waste, an internal team carries out a degaussing exercise to ensure clean-up/ destruction of data on the storage devices prior to the lifting of e-waste by the winning bidder. The whole process from request to disposal including certificate confirmation is carried out in 180 days.\n\n## c. Hazardous Waste\n\nNo hazardous waste is reclaimed for reusing and recycling.\n4.

Describe the processes for identifying key stakeholder groups of the entity\n\nRIL follows a stakeholder centric approach and has established a robust procedure to effectively engage with various internal and external stakeholder groups. As a prerequisite, we identify and prioritise our stakeholders, based on the impacts of the Company on stakeholders and the ability of stakeholder groups to influence the functioning of the Company.\n\nDuring stakeholder identification stage, we consider the Company's positive and negative impacts and which stakeholder groups are either affected by or interested in the same. In the next stage, we prioritise the stakeholder groups that can significantly influence the Company's decision-making process and its operations. As a result, we have identified 6 external and 3 internal stakeholder groups\nsignificant for our operations. Our key external stakeholders include shareholders' investors, government regulators, customers, local communities, suppliers, and NGOs (Non-Government Organisation), while our key internal stakeholders are comprised of our employees, contractual employees and senior management.\nWhile conducting our materiality assessment exercise in FY 2021-22, we extensively interacted with our key stakeholder groups and sought their valuable insights in identifying key material issues. Additionally, we regularly engage with our stakeholders through various channels to seek their input, understand their needs $\\&$ desires, and address their concerns.

Provide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/ marginalised stakeholder groups\nThe teams of Reliance Foundation engage regularly with communities and key identified beneficiaries to understand their existing needs, resolve any concerns and support their progress and development. During FY 2022-23, Reliance Foundation organised multi-stakeholder interactions with various groups such as Farmer Producer Organisations, Stakeholders in Disaster Management and others, through focused deliberation to address concerns. The total reach during the year was over 76.5 lakhs people. In crisis and emergency situations such as disasters, the most vulnerable are sought out to provide support and ensure their safety. The team Reliance Foundation also supports professional training, development and skill building of healthcare providers, coaches, athletes and teaching fraternity to enhance impact on spheres of education, public health and sports for development.\nAt Reliance, stakeholder inclusiveness has been a fundamental part of its responsible CSR practices and is essential in understanding opinions and perceptions of its stakeholders particularly the vulnerable/ marginalised communities and targeted beneficiaries Before initiating a CSR project, an assessment is done to establish rationale for selecting activities based on desired needs of the community, taking into consideration other external factors.\n![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)\n![img-45.jpeg](img-45.jpeg)\n\nThese assessments provide the reference point for designing an intervention that best reflects community aspirations and concerns instead of acting in a top-down manner.\nTools, such as Participatory Rural Appraisals and Rapid Rural Appraisals, are used to develop a joint plan of action for the development of the community with elements of sustainability right from the beginning. This is done by gathering information and opinions from stakeholders i.e. informal leaders, communities, authorities, NGOs and Government Departments through one-on-one meetings, Focused Group Discussions etc. for understanding the local ecosystem and deploying locally relevant solutions to reach out at scale and achieve maximum impact Feedback provided by the communities also forms a critical component in redefining strategies for improvements of the CSR programme. In case of youth skill building and identifying sporting talent, there is a strong grassroots approach to identify talented individuals and provide them with an ecosystem support. In the case of public health, outreach to hard-to-reach areas and developing a cadre of health outreach professionals with infrastructure such as MMUs helps address key health concerns and provide support. To address concerns of these communities, various interventions/actions taken in different focus areas are\n\n1. Helping vulnerable communities cope with disasters through comprehensive, multi-pronged prevention and mitigation strategy.\n2. Ensuring the well-being of rural communities by strengthening the local governance system, empowering communities with knowledge, expertise and livelihood solutions, besides enhancing the rural ecosystem by creation of livelihood assets.\n3. Capability building of the rural communities for diversifying and additional sources of livelihood and employment.\n4. Empowering women by building their leadership and entrepreneurial skills along with providing them with increased access to economic opportunities.\n5.

The LCA was undertaken in accordance with the guidance prescribed by the ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards.\n\n## Objective and Approach\n\nThe objective of the LCA is to understand the environmental performance of the selected products more specifically:\n\n- To identify and quantify the impact of 'refinery' and 'petrochemical (including polyester)' products;\n- To identify which stages of the life cycle of the selected products contribute to such impacts;\n- To understand the drivers determining life cycle impacts;\n- To identify and investigate potential improvement opportunities, if any.\n\nThe inventory data for the fiscal year 2021-22 has been modeled using the LCA tool. The inventory data covers all unit processes pertaining to the refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) division and includes input feed, output products, waste generation, and utility inputs.\n\nThe assessment included 5 most relevant environmental impacts namely acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine), eutrophication (freshwater), and water use. The Company assessed impacts on the five categories which are acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine), eutrophication (freshwater), and water use.\n![img-83.jpeg](img-83.jpeg)\n\n## Scope\n\n## System Boundary and Product System\n\nThe product system included processes in the 'Cradle-to-Gate' phase, i.e., from the extraction of raw materials to the manufacturing of products. The boundary of the assessment included:\n\n1. The refinery division of the Jamnagar facility covering two refining complexes located in the Domestic Tariff Area (DTA) and Special Economic Zone (SEZ).\n2. The petrochemical (including polyester) divisions include nine facilities located in Jamnagar (JMD), Hazira (HMD), Dahej (DMD), Vadodara (VMD), Patalganga (PMD), Nagothane (NMD), Silvassa (SMD), Hoshiarpur (HoMD) and Barabanki (BMD).\n![img-84.jpeg](img-84.jpeg)\n\n## Functional Unit\n\nThe functional unit has been defined as the per kilogram (kg) of the manufactured products.\n\n## LCIA Methodology\n\nThe Environmental Footprint (Mid-point Indicator) has been followed for the assessment of relevant environmental impacts of the selected products. Midpoint Indicators quantify the potential environmental impacts of a product, process, or activity based on\nspecific environmental categories, such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, and human toxicity, and are based on scientific models that link emissions and inventory to specific environmental impacts.\nMid-point indicators were considered given that they are widely accepted and are less affected by uncertainties and assumption and make them more comparable and consistent across different studies and databases Furthermore, Mid-point indicators are more transparent and understandable for audiences, making them effective and credible for communication.", "metadata": {"source": "streamlit_temp_BRSR202223.pdf", "page": 52, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "## Impact Categories\n\n| Impact Potentials | Acidification | Global Marrring | Marine Eutrophication | Freshwater Eutrophication | Water Severity |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Potential Contribution | Evaluates the potential contribution of a product toward acid rain | Evaluates the potential of a product to contribute to climate change by releasing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). | Evaluates product's potential to contribute to nutrient enrichment into marine bodies, which lead to growth of algae and other aquatic plants. | Evaluates product's potential to contribute to nutrient enrichment into freshwater bodies, which lead to growth of algae and other aquatic plants. | Evaluates potential impact of water consumption and withdrawal on the availability of freshwater resources. |\n| Contributors | Sulphur dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen oxides (NOx) | Equivalent CO2 emission | Equivalent Nitroate compounds | Equivalent Phosphate compound | Equivalent water consumption |\n\n## Results\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nRefinery: Crude Oil is the raw material used in refinery operations.\nPetrochemical (including polyester) operations: Ethane, recycled PET bottles, chemicals and processed products from refinery are used as raw materials in petrochemical operations.\n\n## Energy Use\n\nRefinery: Majority of the total energy consumed within the refinery to produce selected products during FY 2021-22 are met from off gas and syngas derived from pet coke gasification process, and rest of the energy demand is fulfilled from fossil fuels at 3 amnagar manufacturing division.\nPetrochemical (including polyester) operations: Total energy consumed for production of selected petrochemical products was sourced from combustion of fuels such as coal, natural gas, ethane, off gas generated within the process, biofuels, and grid electricity.\n\n## Water Use\n\nRefinery: Desalinated water was used in refinery operations. The Company has in-house desalination plants based on Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Multi-Effect Evaporator (MEE) technologies. After desalination, brine water was pumped back into ocean.\nPetrochemical (including polyester) operations: Water used in the petrochemical operation was primarily sourced from surface water resources.\n\n## Lifecycle Impact Analysis\n\nThe results have been calculated across 5 impact categories for the 18 products listed below. The results can be shared on a case-to-case basis upon request.\n\n| Refinery Products | Petrochemical (including polyester) <br> Products |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Allylate | Aromatics |\n| Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) | Filament |\n| Diesel | Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) |\n| Fuel Oil | Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) |\n| Gasoline | Polyethylene (PE) |\n| Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) | Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) |\n| Naphtha | Polypropylene (PP) |\n| Sulphur | Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA) |\n| TAME | Staples |\n\nThese 18 products contribute to over $90 \\%$ of the total turnover.\n\n## Summary\n\nDuring the study, no significant issues were identified pertaining to all impact categories. However, the following inference were derived from the LCA assessment:\n\n## Climate Change\n\nRefinery and petrochemical operations demonstrate high energy efficiency. In addition, internal benchmarking was carried out for refinery and petrochemical products, comparing them to the available benchmarks. Within the Cradle to Gate boundary, the upstream sources of GHG emissions are crude oil, fuel and other feedstock exploration and transportation.\n\nSources of GHG emissions in operations are primarily from combustion of fuels for process heat and from hydrogen generation. The use of green hydrogen can help in reducing the carbon footprint of the products. The Company's ongoing efforts in green hydrogen are aligned to fulfill this aspect.\nPower and steam consumption in refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations also contribute to GHG emissions. Currently, the primary fuel utilised for power and steam generation in refinery operations is syngas produced from the pet coke gasification process. In petrochemical (including polyester) operations, grid electricity and coal are the predominant energy sources. However, with the company's ongoing efforts to transition to renewable energy, and adapting biofuels and low-carbon fuels, it is possible to reduce the carbon footprint associated with refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) products.\nThough the Company does not have direct control over upstream GHG emissions associated with crude oil and other raw materials exploration and transportation, it is working towards yield improvement and optimisation. Furthermore, the Company is evaluating available alternatives to explore sourcing crude oil with a lower environmental footprint.\n\n## Water Use\n\nIn refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) operations, water is used primarily for cooling processes and steam generation. The Company has implemented initiatives for steam condensate recovery to reduce water requirements for steam generation. It is using desalinated water in its refinery operations to reduce its reliance on freshwater withdrawal.\n\n## Acidification\n\nMajor gate-to-gate contributors to acidification are fuel combustion and combustion of other refinery and petrochemical off-gases. The Company is aiming to move towards substituting more renewable energy in place of fossil fuels which will reduce the quantity of Sulphur entering the ecosystem, hence, further lowering the acidification potential.\n\n## Eutrophication (Marine and Freshwater)\n\nThe operations conducted within the refinery and petrochemical (including polyester) divisions do not directly contribute to eutrophication in marine and freshwater environments. However, the impacts related to eutrophication are associated with the upstream emissions generated during the production of raw materials.", "metadata": {"source": "streamlit_temp_BRSR202223.pdf", "page": 53, "chunk_index": 0}}, {"text": "![img-85.jpeg](img-85.jpeg)", "metadata": {"source": "streamlit_temp_BRSR202223.pdf", "page": 54, "chunk_index": 0}}]
