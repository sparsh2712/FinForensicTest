Skilling initiatives are essential to bridge this gap, equipping individuals with the necessary competencies to meet the demands of various industries, including technology, manufacturing, and services. By investing in skill development, India can enhance employability, reduce poverty, and ensure that its youth contribute effectively to the nation's economic progress.
