[Meta Agent] Starting iteration 2/3
[Meta Agent] Evaluating research quality...
[Meta Agent] Research quality score: 7/10
[Meta Agent] Assessment: The research provides a good overview of potential risks and concerns related to Reliance Industries, covering areas like legal disputes, corruption allegations, and financial irregularities. The sources are generally credible, including reputable news outlets like the Financial Times, The Hindu, Business Standard, and Livemint. However, the balance is somewhat lacking, as it focuses heavily on negative news without much context or counter-arguments from the company. The inclusion of quarterly/annual results is good for context, but the 'Financial Reporting' section also includes a clearly false and sensationalist article from 'THE PHILOX' which hurts the credibility of the section. The coverage is decent, but there are still some gaps, particularly in areas like corporate governance, ESG factors, and competitive positioning.

The credibility is further enhanced by the involvement of multiple regulatory bodies (SEBI, MCA, PMO, President's Secretariat) and the consistent pursuit of the matter by Dr. Thakur.", 'raw_extract': 'The former medical director of the Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, in Maharashtra’s Raigad district, Dr Sanjay Thakur was approached by representatives of Reliance Industries Limited in early November 2020, with a settlement offer to withdraw his case of illegal termination against the business house. Thakur was fired in June 2017, a few months after he reported various instances of financial irregularities, mismanagement and corporate-governance failure at DAH, to RIL’s ethics committee. The nature of Thakur’s complaints made him a whistle-blower, and after his dismissal, Thakur further escalated his complaints to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, and other state and central government authorities. Thakur told me that the settlement offer at the end of 2020 was an inducement to withdraw all his complaints, across forums.\n\nHe first approached RIL’s ethics committee, known as the Ethics and Compliance Task Force, via an email on 19 January 2017. The mail highlighted irregularities and mismanagement of funds, including delays in repairs, purchases, and escalated bills at the DAH, bringing to the fore some of the reasons for the hospital’s steady decline and failure. Over the next few months, he escalated his complaints to senior RIL officials, including Mukesh Ambani.\n\nBeginning July 2017, Thakur approached SEBI, the ministry of finance, the ministry of corporate affairs, the health department of Maharashtra, as well as the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Secretariat. In his complaints to each of them, he listed a series of wrongdoings. These included failure of vigil mechanisms, whistle-blower victimisation, failure to follow the process of disclosure of whistle-blower complaints, and CSR irregularities by RIL, Reliance Hospital Management Services Private Limited, which runs DAH, and Reliance Foundation.\n\nThakur said that for over two years, SEBI and the MCA have consistently stonewalled his complaints against the business house. SEBI has closed at least ten complaints filed by Thakur since 2017, while forwarding the sections of his complaints dealing with CSR to the MCA. On the other hand, according to communication between Thakur and the MCA, an investigation initiated by the MCA, in 2018, appears to have not proceeded further while another inquiry started in October 2020 is still ongoing. The documents further reveal that both SEBI and MCA accepted RIL’s responses to Thakur’s complaints without any independent probe and forwarded the same to Thakur. This points to a failure in monitoring and regulating the provisions for whistle-blowers and CSR compliance at one of India’s largest public-listed companies. Barely a month after the MCA’s latest inquiry, Shrinivas Shanbag, the former [director](https://www.zaubacorp.com/company/RELIANCE-HOSPITAL-MANAGEMENT-SERVICES-PRIVATE-LIMITED/U85100MH1998PTC114935) of RHMSPL, initiated negotiations for the settlement offer.\n\n“_Shanbag_ reached out to me in November. They have offered Rs 50 lakh for both of us,” to withdraw all complaints and settle the matter, Thakur told me.\n\nAccording to the company’s reports, RIL was transferring CSR funds to Reliance Foundation, which was then sending the money to another Reliance Group company, RHMSPL.\n\nEmail communication between Thakur and RIL officials, as well as the company’s responses to SEBI and MCA, show that Thakur first reported irregularities and mismanagement of funds, including delays in repairs, purchases, and escalated bills at the DAH, to RIL’s ethics committee on 19 January 2017 via an email.\n\nAccording to the RIL’s [code of conduct](https://www.ril.com/DownloadFiles/IRStatutory/Code-of-Conduct.pdf), the ethics committee must process and investigate protected disclosures to “look into genuine concerns concerning actual or suspected practices including fraudulent practices, such as improperly tampering with RIL books and records.”\n\nAccording to Thakur’s communication with SEBI, instead of looking into the irregularities raised by Thakur, the ethics committee asked him to prepare a turn-around plan with an investment of Rs 3 crore and a business model to increase revenue via an email on 24 February 2017.\n\nOn 21 February, Thakur wrote his first email to senior RIL officials including Mukesh, Nita Ambani and two others. Thakur wrote that there were “significant irregularities in functioning of Finance, Pathology, Pharmacy, radiology, vendor engagements and staff functioning.” Almost a page of the letter has details of these irregularities, such as, the annual maintenance cost was being paid for equipment that was non-functional and the repair of 18-year-old ultra sound machine was pending for over three years. He also wrote that “audit of finance by KPMG had pointed to glaring deficiencies,” but no step was taken to resolve the issues highlighted by the international auditing firm.\n\nThe letter also mentions that he was being pressurised to award a contract for a laboratory to an unlicensed, small lab, bypassing a better-equipped lab.\n\nIn its annual report for 2016-17, RIL claimed that DAH was an “82-bed state-of-the-art hospital catering to the industrial and rural population in the Raigad district of Maharashtra.” It claimed that the patients were “provided free consultation, counselling, investigation and treatment.” Under the CSR expenditure for the year, RIL showed an expenditure of Rs 4.1 crore on the DAH, and a total of Rs 9.6 crore till then.\n\nThakur filed his first complaint with SEBI in July that year, but the organisation said the matter was not under its purview. In September, he wrote to SEBI again about CSR irregularities, failure of vigil mechanism, whistle-blower victimisation and non-disclosure of complaint. Two months later, SEBI forwarded the complaint regarding misutilisation of CSR funds to the Registrar of Companies under the MCA.\n\nBut SEBI did not take any action on the violation of whistle-blower provisions and non-disclosure of whistle-blower complaint. SEBI first wrote to RIL in October 2017. The next month, RIL sent back two responses, which SEBI accepted without any further probe. SEBI overlooked the fact that the RIL’s annual report of 2016-17 did not mention Thakur’s whistle-blower complaint. None of RIL’s subsequent annual reports mention this and the annual reports of 2016–17 and 2017–18 stated that the company had complied with SEBI guidelines, and listed complaints where SEBI has taken action. SEBI did not respond to queries on these.\n\nThe 2016–17 report also stated, “During the year under review, no employee was denied access to the Audit Committee.”\n\nThakur told me that he repeatedly wrote to SEBI to point out that he had not till date been given an audience before the Audit Committee, in violation of the LODR 2015.\n\nOn 7 December 2017, the finance ministry wrote to the executive director of SEBI, SV Muralidhara Rao, to take necessary action and submit a reply.\n\nIn its November 2017 responses to SEBI, RIL dismissed the complaints as “an attempt by a frustrated employee” and said that he raised the complaints “after a decision was made by the company to close the DAH.” While Thakur had raised specific instances of financial irregularities and mismanagement in his complaint, RIL wrote that his February 2017 letter to Ambani was “vague and did not contain specific instance of malpractice or corruption.” But then goes on to say that “the issues raised by Sr. Sanjay Thakur should have been handled by Sanjay Thakur himself, as he was the head of the Hospital.”\n\nIn his rebuttal to Reliance’s response, Thakur had pointed out that “attempts to address issues at DAH were blocked cleverly by various approval processes quoted to me as state in my email.” In his first letter to the management of RIL in February 2017, Thakur had stated that he was being misguided about the approval processes and had cited an example where “even the budget for last year was not approved yet and new budget is being proposed now without any discussion with me.”\n\nAccording to RIL, its Business Integrity team had visited the hospital and found the complaints to be “frivolous and unsubstantiated.” RIL further claimed that the ethics committee discussed the matter at a meeting held on 10 October 2017—three months after terminating the service of Thakur—and also concluded that the complaint was “frivolous, non-specific and no further action was needed.” RIL claimed to have followed the whistle-blower policy under the LODR 2015.\n\nIn his rebuttal, Thakur pointed that RIL’s response had falsely claimed to have sent the ethics committee report.\n\nUpon feeling that his complaints were being stonewalled, Thakur reported the failure of the SEBI officials handling the complaint to the Central Vigilance Commission on 4 April 2018.\n\nFrom 2017-20, Thakur filed ten complaints on the [SCORES](https://scores.gov.in/) portal—the SEBI Complaints Redress System, which is an online platform for investors to lodge complaints against listed companies. All ten were closed by SEBI. Thakur reported SEBI’s inaction to CVC thrice, which further directed the CVO SEBI to take necessary action, but Thakur did not get any response from the CVO SEBI.\xa0During this entire process, Thakur consistently wrote to the finance ministry, the PMO and the President’s Secretariat. Several official memorandums from the finance ministry and the MCA show that, based on references from the PMO and the President’s Secretariat, these two ministries had directed SEBI to look into Thakur’s complaints. However, SEBI ignored all of Thakur’s rebuttals to RIL’s submissions and forwarded RIL’s response to the PMO, the MCA and the finance ministry and said that it had looked into the matter and taken action.\n\nAdwait Dahale, from the compliance and monitoring division in SEBI’s corporation finance department, submitted an action-taken report on 17 June 2020. He wrote, “allegations regarding victimization as a whistle blower were taken up and it was found that RIL has followed the processes as per the Whistle Blower policy and complied with provisions pertaining to Vigil Mechanism.” Based on RIL’s responses to SEBI, Dahale further wrote that “prima facie no violations” of the LODR 2015 was found. He wrote that SEBI had already replied to the repeat complaints and asked Thakur to follow up with the MCA on the CSR fund misuse.\n\nIn the midst of this, in March 2020, Facebook announced its plan to invest in the Reliance Group’s digital business unit, Jio Platforms Limited and by June, it had invested Rs 43,574 crore for a ten percent stake in Jio. Thakur alerted Facebook’s legal team about his pending complaints of CSR irregularities, whistle-blower victimisation and corporate governance failure, in March and followed up with an email on 15 May. The Facebook legal team had sought Thakur’s consent on 26 May to forward his complaint to RIL for its response. Notably, on 9 June, SEBI closed Thakur’s November 2019 complaint on the SCORES portal.\n\nUndeterred, on 31 August 2020, Thakur again approached the DEA to protest SEBI’s inaction. “SEBI has thus far blindly accepted RIL’s denial response,” Thakur wrote to Rosemary K. Abraham, the director of DEA. His letter noted that the timing of SEBI’s closure of his complaint in June 2020 was “ample evidence of backchannel activity involving RIL and SEBI after Facebook took cognizance. An impartial probe will surely unravel SEBI insiders nexus to give a clean chit to RIL.”\n\nWhile SEBI dealt with the whistle-blower aspect of Thakur’s complaints, the regulator forwarded his complaint about CSR irregularities in DAH to the MCA.\xa0\n\nIn June 2019, the MCA again sent a notice to RIL on the violation of CSR rules, according to a report published in _[DNA](https://web.archive.org/web/20190619150051/https:/www.dnaindia.com/business/report-dna-exclusive-ril-under-lens-for-diverting-rs-17k-cr-csr-funds-2762478%20)_. The report noted that the company had recorded a CSR expenditure of Rs 2,816 crore from 2014 to 2018 but it was “being seen as business expenditure and not CSR.” It quoted the MCA notice, “Prima facie you appear to be in violation of provision of Companies Act 2013, as use of CSR as a source of funding an existing business is not permissible.” The report said that the MCA was looking into the company’s CSR expenditure of Rs 1,739 crore spent, of which Rs 1,141 crore was spent on HN Reliance Hospital Foundation and Research Centre, Rs 8 crore on DAH and Rs 590 crore on the Jio University.\n\nThe report further said that the MCA had found the company’s earlier response to it “not satisfactory.” It warned that “a final opportunity is being accorded to … explain your compliance of CSR provisions … and are requested to appear for a hearing on the matter in person, to demonstrate through legal documents how the prescribed CSR amount has been spent and CSR compliance had been made.”\n\nOn 19 June 2019, the Bombay Stock Exchange sought a [response](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/announcements/others/reliance-industries-ltd-clarification-sought-from-reliance-industries-ltd/article28074402.ece) from RIL on the news report. Six days later, in a misleading response, RIL said that MCA has been seeking information on company’s CSR from time to time and “it has recently sought additional information on CSR projects and the Company is in the process of providing the same to MCA.” In response to our queries, a Reliance Foundation spokesperson wrote saying, “We would like to state that our Company has duly complied with all the requirements of various statutory provisions related to CSR under the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (CSR Policy) Rules, 2014).” The spokesperson added, “We iterate that the allegations levelled by Dr. S.S. Thakur are baseless and defamatory It is obvious that his emails have been addressed with ulterior, motivated and mala-fide reasons and purely as a counter blast to the decision taken due to his termination of employment.”\n\nOn 15 June 2020, the PMO again referred Thakur’s letter to the finance ministry based on which the ministry issued an office memorandum dated 7 December asking the MCA to take necessary action. In December 2020, Vedant Ojha, an assistant director at the MCA, wrote to Thakur to inform him that he had been appointed as an inspector under [sub-section 4 of section 206](http://ebook.mca.gov.in/Actpagedisplay.aspx?PAGENAME=17600) of the Companies Act, 2013, to examine CSR compliance of RIL. According to this, if the registrar is “satisfied on the basis of information available” that the company had “fraudulent or unlawful purpose” or conducted business not in compliance with the act, an inspector is appointed to probe the matter. It gives the inspector powers to call for information and documents.”\n\nHowever, two weeks later, Ojha wrote to Thakur that his complaints contained “mostly media articles and also the content of mail are generic in nature. All these does not provide specific instances of violations of provision of CSR.” In his reply, Thakur wrote that as per the law the inspector was expected to procure audit reports from RIL, RF and RHMSP, and “promptly call a hearing, record my statement, summon RIL RF RHMSPL officials procure call records” to ensure due process was followed. According to documents shared by Thakur, on 30 March 2021, the registrar of companies—an office under the MCA which deals with the administration of companies—forwarded Reliance Foundations’ response to the allegations regarding CSR irregularities, to him. The Foundation’s response reiterated the same points as mentioned in RIL’s response to SEBI in November 2017. But Thakur has not yet got a response from Ojha, and the MCA did not respond to any queries regarding Thakur’s complaints.\n\nOn 12 November, less than a month after Ojha was assigned to Thakur’s complaint, Shanbag first reached out to Thakur. According to screenshots of the conversations, following the first meeting between the Thakurs and Reliance’s representatives, Shanbag again wrote to Thakur on 18 December, and said that he was disappointed they could not take the discussion forward. He advised Thakur to settle on a reasonable figure instead of getting involved in a long-drawn struggle. Shanbag offered to meet again, alone. Shanbag reiterated this offer on 22 January and the Thakurs met him again on 25 January.\n\nThe Thakurs, however, have refused to accept the terms to withdraw all complaints. In addition, they said, the compensation offered was lower than the figure arrived at by Thakur’s lawyers.

The credibility is moderate, pending further investigation and response from the RBI and the courts.", 'raw_extract': 'It was on 19 July 2013, about a year and a half ago, that the ED wrote to the RBI, seeking its advice on the legality of a loan of Rs 6,530.36 crore that was granted by an overseas branch of ICICI bank to a now-defunct firm called Biometrix Marketing Pte Ltd that was based in Singapore and associated with the Reliance Group. Curiously, this money, given in the form of a loan, later returned to India—as alleged by First Secretary (Economic) GT Venkateswara Rao\xa0of the Indian High Commision in Singapore in the investigation he conducted on investments made by Biometrix in Reliance Group companies—as foreign direct investment (FDI) through the issuance of certain financial instruments called compulsorily convertible preferential shares (CCPS) by Biometrix in four Reliance Group companies—Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, Relogistics Infrastructure, Reliance Ports and Reliance Utilities.\n\nSenior officials of the ED have said that, since the letter was written, Annu Tandon and other senior figures connected with RIL have been questioned about the transactions relating to Biometrix and their statements have been recorded.\n\nRao&#39;s\xa0[investigation](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/reliance-industries-arm-s-investments-still-being-probed-114072100029_1.html) into Biometrix&#39;s investments was first suggested in July 2011 by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) in the Union Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which is responsible for formulating and enforcing policies on FDI.\n\nThe report pointed out that the records of Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) indicated that Biometrix was a holding company registered in Singapore. A company called Strasbourg Holdings Private Limited held 91 percent of Biometrix. Strasbourg is incorporated in Singapore and is owned by Atul Shantikumar Dayal, a legal expert with AS Dayal &amp; Associates, Mumbai, who has been of particular assistance to the Reliance Group in [some of](http://indianlawyer250.com/news/article/271/supreme-court-rule-appointment-foreign-arbitrator/)[its recent](http://www.infraline.com/Details/Ministry-Plans-Strategy-Around-Arbitration-Notice-From-Ril-Regarding-Cost-Recovery-167481.htm) arbitration cases against agencies of the Indian government, and who is also a director of a few Reliance Group companies.\n\nMany India-based corporate conglomerates, in particular the Reliance Group, maintain a complex structure of cross-holdings of shares among subsidiary and associate companies. Theoretically, these cross-holdings are perfectly legal. However, the patterns of shareholdings of these companies are often made deliberately complex to make it difficult for regulatory authorities to lift the corporate veil and establish the identities of the beneficiaries. If their identities are obfuscated, it makes it cumbersome to establish an audit trail to track the flow of funds. This case, in particular, appears to use a set of such complex control structures.\n\nIn its reply, the RBI stated that borrowings by an “overseas WOS (wholly owned subsidiary) / JV (joint-venture), (a) first level step down subsidiary or subsidiaries beyond first level, with support from the Indian party for purposes of investment back into India” was not a “bona fide business activity as per FEMA guidelines framed in 2004.” The country’s central bank added that the case was being examined by officials in the RBI’s Department of Banking Operations and Development and that the apex bank would respond to the ED in due course.\n\nRepresentatives of the Reliance Group have claimed to the ED that the investments should not be treated as FDI but as an external commercial borrowing (ECB). If the investment is indeed an ECB, this would put Reliance in the clear and in compliance with the RBI and provisions of FEMA. This is the crux of the dispute. Did the money return from Singapore to India as FDI or as an ECB?\n\nIf the money did indeed return from Singapore as an FDI, then there is\xa0reason to pay attention to the possible source of these funds. Prashant Bhushan, a lawyer and founding member of the Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) offered an interesting explanation to this question at a press conference, which we will come to later in this article. In June 2011, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, [had made note of](http://newsclick.in/india/reliance-kg-gas-scam) anomalies in the capital cost of the RIL natural gas project in the D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG). The CAG’s report stated that Reliance had over-invoiced their imports of capital equipment during the project. Taking off from this report, Bhushan alleged that the funds transferred from Biometrix had been illegally obtained through RIL’s fudging of its imports.\n\nTo begin with, the mammoth investments, amounting to Rs 6,530.36 crore came from companies—Biometrix and Strasbourg—which had relatively small equity capital bases. Biometrix was set up with an equity capital of 110,000 Singapore dollars—or approximately Rs 29 lakh—and operated out of “just one room, which was closed most of the time.” Rao’s report added that the premises where Strasbourg was registered was occupied by another firm named Rikvin (about which, too, more interesting information will follow).\xa0Filings with ACRA,\xa0[reviewed by the](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/reliance-industries-arm-s-investments-still-being-probed-114072100029_1.html)\xa0_[Business Standard](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/reliance-industries-arm-s-investments-still-being-probed-114072100029_1.html)_\xa0indicated that between May 2007 and September 2008, Biometrix made a loss of Rs 400 crore on a revenue of 121,433 Singapore dollars (approximately Rs 32 lakh). Its total liabilities to equity ratio was an improbable 4,637 because it had obtained a $1.7 billion Singapore-dollar loan with a capital of 110,000 Singapore dollars (approximately Rs 29 lakh). ACRA’s\xa0[records](http://www.slidesearch.org/slide/acra-biometrix-marketing-business-profile-and-3-x-statements-containing-particulars-of-charge)\xa0show that Biometrix has been dissolved and that its members voluntarily wound up the company.\xa0_Business Standard_\xa0also\xa0[reported](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/reliance-industries-arm-s-investments-still-being-probed-114072100029_1.html)\xa0that the loan obtained by Biometrix had been paid off.\n\nRao’s investigations through the High Commission of India in Singapore point to several suspicious facts that deem this case worthy of close scrutiny.\n\nHe also stated that it was highly probable that the funds shown as loans from Singapore or other “tax heavens” \\[sic\\] returned through a “circuitous route” to companies whose owners were in India. Therefore, he argued, the source of the money needed to be ascertained.\n\nOn 22 June 2012, M Furquan, a Delhi-based journalist, wrote to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) asking the two agencies to investigate whether or not the transactions were legal. His allegation was based on certain documents—including first secretary Rao’s report from August 2011—that he claimed to have received from a reliable source through registered post. After he received no response from either the CVC or the CBI, he filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court on 17 November 2012.\n\nFurquan pointed out that during the period between March 2007 and October 2008, RIL&#39;s warrants worth Rs 16,500 crore were converted into equity shares by\xa0Reliance Utilities Private Limited, Reliance Ports &amp; Terminals Limited, Relogistics Infrastructure Limited and Reliance Gas Transportation Limited\xa0as per the records of the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. The holder of a warrant can purchase securities, usually equity shares, from the issuer at a specific price within a certain time frame.\xa0Furquan’s petition alleges that the money required for converting RIL’s warrants into shares by the four RIL subsidiaries came from none other than RIL itself as none of the four subsidiaries had shown a commensurate amount of external or bank borrowing and neither did they have any influx of income of such magnitude.\n\nHe alleged that part of this money came into RIL in the form of a loan of $1.7 billion Singapore dollars—approximately Rs 6,500 crore at the time—from Biometrix, which was “shown as subscription money for preference shares (CCPS) \\[compulsorily convertible preferential shares\\] issued by Reliance Utilities Private Limited, Reliance Ports &amp; Terminals Limited, Relogistics Infrastructure Limited &amp; Reliance Gas Transportation Limited.” \xa0This means that Biometrix raised the money from ICICI on the ground that it sought to buy CCPS shares issued by the four subsidiaries.\n\nFurquan subsequently claimed that, after his petition was filed in court, Swatantra Kumar, Director General, Income Tax (Investigation), who was based in Mumbai, had commenced a probe into the transactions relating to Biometrix and companies in the Reliance Group. However, Kumar was suddenly transferred to Chandigarh in December 2012. The case itself is still pending in the Delhi High Court.\n\nWe were able to gain access to the documents submitted by Furquan in court. Among these is a letter written by LV Merchant, Director, RLSPL, to MG Attri, Assistant Director, ED, on 14 August 2012 which makes the holding structure of Biometrix and its relationship with RIL extremely clear.\n\nThe letter states that 49 percent of the shares of Reliance Holding Netherlands BV (RHBV), Netherlands, were held by Reliance Clinical Research Services Pvt Ltd (RCRS), which is a subsidiary of Reliance Life Sciences Pvt Ltd (RLSPL). The remaining 51 percent was held by RLSPL. In 2006, RHBV acquired 79.58 percent of GeneMedix Plc—a company listed on a stock exchange in London—with the balance being held by public shareholders. GeneMedix acquired Biometrix in 2007, thus making it an “indirect subsidiary” of RLSPL.\n\nBiometrix’s loan from ICICI Bank was taken under a “Put and Call Option Agreement” with Ekansha Enterprises Private Limited, a group company of RLSPL. An option agreement between two companies—in this case between Biometrix and Ekansha—provides either of the two firms with the right, but not the obligation, to buy, sell or obtain a specific asset at an agreed upon price at some time in the future.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2008, when the transactions involving Biometrix took place, Atul Shantikumar Dayal was a director of thirty-two companies, quite a few of which were part of the Reliance Group, including Reliance Power Ventures Ltd, Reliance Enterprises Ltd, Reliance Petroleum Ltd, Ekansha Enterprises Pvt Ltd and Strasbourg Holdings. As mentioned earlier, Dayal is reportedly a close adviser to the Reliance Group on corporate law, indirect taxation and, notably, international commercial contracts. According to the ED report, Strasbourg Holdings was acquired from Dayal by the late Sandeep Tandon, husband to Annu Tandon. The acquisition was made through a remittance of US$100,000 (approximately Rs 48 lakh) to Singapore under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) of the RBI that was announced in February 2004. Under the LRS at that time, resident Indians were allowed to remit up to $125,000 (approximately Rs 60 lakh) in each financial year for any permitted capital and/or current account transaction or a combination of both.\n\nAnnu was managing director of MoTech Software Ltd., which had been promoted by Mukesh Ambani. In 2007, MoTech was one of twelve entities that came under the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) [over charges of insider trading in the shares](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/insider-trading-cloud-on-firms-linked-to-anand-jain-annu-tandon-113010700052_1.html) of Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL). On 3 January 2008, two months after the RPL transactions, she resigned from her position, citing her decision to contest elections from Uttar Pradesh as the reason.\n\nThe senior officials in the ED have said that both Shalin and Annu Tandon, as well as Dayal have been questioned. The RBI is yet to respond to the ED’s query on whether certain transactions by RIL violate the provisions of FEMA.\n\nBoth the Reliance Group companies—Strasbourg and Ekansha—applied to the RBI for compounding for their violation of the FEMA act as noted by the RBI. Ekansha paid Rs 19.59 crore to the RBI as the fee for compounding. An application on behalf of the late Sandeep Tandon, for Strasbourg, is still pending with the RBI.\n\nInformation about this unusual transfer of funds was brought into the public domain for the first time by Prashant Bhushan at a media conference on 27 February 2014. Bhushan pointed out that the Indian High Commission in Singapore had made enquiries about Biometrix following a request by the DIPP in 2011, but the government had failed to act [on the information provided](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/aap-questions-reliance-on-6500cr-investment-by-two-singapore-firms/article5733229.ece), even after three years.\n\nAfter Bhushan’s conference, RIL released a [press statement](http://www.moneycontrol.com/livefeed_pdf/Feb2014/pressrelease.pdf) in which it denied that its legal adviser, Dayal, was either the owner or the director of Biometrix. With reference to the loan given by the Singapore company, RIL stated:\n\nThe investments by Biometrix were open, transparent and perfectly legitimate transactions in full compliance with the extant regulations. These investments in the Indian companies were made by Biometrix out of loans raised from ICICI Bank, Singapore branch. ICICI Bank has confirmed this fact to the regulators. Regulatory authorities have fully investigated the matter and found no substance in the allegations of money laundering. The insinuation that this money was from “gold plating” from KG-D6 is completely irresponsible and false.\n\nBhushan, in a letter dated 8 July 2014, to the Special Investigation Team on black money—formed by the government on the orders of the Supreme Court—alleged that the government “has just sat over these facts \\[relating to Biometrix\\] for … three years now,” and that the government “has not bothered to investigate this case of money laundering, perhaps because powerful entities like Reliance are involved.”\n\nOn 23 July 2014, Bhushan [wrote to](http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/unearthing-illicit-money) Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking, “why would a bank give such a large loan to a post box company with no known assets and source of income? Given the fact that the CAG \\[Comptroller and Auditor General\\] report has already indicted Reliance for over-invoicing and siphoning out money from the KG-D6 contract, isn’t it highly likely that the Rs 6,500 crore was in fact money siphoned out of the country by Reliance from the KG-D6 contract, or dealing with the government, and which was being brought back by way of an investment by a shell company?”\n\nBhushan enclosed with his letter Rao’s commercial intelligence report, which stated: “The equity of both the investing companies—Biometrix and Strasbourg—from Singapore is very small compared to the amount invested; both the companies have claimed exemption from filing annual accounts to the Singapore regulator stating that the income is small. If the income was small, the question arises about the source of such huge amounts were \\[sic\\] raised.”\n\nWhy is the RBI dragging its feet in answering the ED as to whether the complicated maze of transactions relating to these companies violated the provisions of the law? Is this is a case of money laundering? How can the foreign associate of an Indian bank lend money to a firm that uses the funds to purchase financial instruments of companies that are associated with the parent company in India? These questions remain unanswered.

The allegations center around potential money laundering and violations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) through a circuitous investment route. Specifically, a loan of approximately Rs 6,530.36 crore was granted by ICICI Bank Singapore to Biometrix, which then invested in Reliance Group companies as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) via compulsorily convertible preferential shares (CCPS). The source of these funds is questioned, with suggestions linking it to over-invoicing in RIL's KG-D6 project. Further, it is alleged that RIL subsidiaries used funds originating from RIL itself to convert warrants into equity shares, with the Biometrix loan serving as the ultimate source.\n\nKey entities involved include RIL, ICICI Bank (Singapore), Biometrix, and several RIL subsidiaries. Regulatory bodies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), and the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) have also been involved in investigating the matter.\n\nThe timeline of events spans from 2007 to 2014, with key milestones including the initial investment by Biometrix, CAG's identification of anomalies in the KG-D6 project's capital costs, and subsequent investigations by various regulatory bodies.

RIL has denied the allegations, claiming the investments were legitimate and compliant with regulations.\n\nThe magnitude of the alleged irregularities is significant, involving substantial sums of money and potentially impacting RIL's financial standing and reputation. The small equity capital of Biometrix relative to the loan amount and subsequent investment raises concerns about the legitimacy of the transactions.\n\nFurther investigation is warranted to determine the true source of funds for the Biometrix loan and whether any violations of FEMA or other regulations occurred.

The central allegation is that RIL illegally extracted gas that migrated from adjacent blocks owned by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), resulting in unjust enrichment for RIL and financial losses for ONGC and the Indian government. The alleged period of extraction extends up to March 31, 2016. The government initially demanded $1.55 billion from RIL, including royalties and interest, for the extraction of 338.332 million British thermal units of gas. An international arbitration tribunal initially ruled in favor of RIL in 2018, awarding them $8.3 million. However, the Delhi High Court overturned this arbitral award on February 15, 2025, reigniting the legal battle.

Furthermore, RIL is accused of failing to disclose crucial data, specifically the D&M 2003, D&M 2004, and D&M 2005 Reports, to the Union of India (UOI) regarding gas migration, violating Article 26.1 of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).

Furthermore, RIL has experienced three consecutive quarters of profit decline. These financial difficulties, coupled with the layoff allegations, present a complex picture of the company's current state. The credibility of the layoff allegations is rated as medium, while the financial performance data is considered credible due to its basis in reported financial results.
